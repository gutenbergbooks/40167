<h2><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h2>

<p>The following pages contain the results of archaeological investigations
carried on by the writer for the American Museum of Natural History from
May to August, 1903,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in the Yakima Valley between Clealum of the forested
eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains and Kennewick, between the mouths
of the Yakima and Snake Rivers in the treeless arid region, and in the
Columbia Valley in the vicinity of Priest Rapids. My preliminary notes
on the archaeology of this region were published in Science.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Definite age
cannot be assigned to the archaeological finds, since here, as to the north,
the remains are found at no great depth or in soil the surface of which is
frequently shifted. Some of the graves are known to be of modern Indians,
but many of them antedate the advent of the white race in this region or at
least contain no objects of European manufacture, such as glass beads or
iron knives. On the other hand, there was found no positive evidence of
the great antiquity of any of the skeletons, artifacts or structures found in
the area. The greater part of the area was formerly inhabited by Sahaptian
speaking people, including the Yakima, Atanum, Topinish, Chamnapum,
and Wanapum, while the northern part of it was occupied by the
Piskwans or Winatshmpui of the Salish linguistic stock.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Near North Yakima we examined graves in the rock-slides along the
Yakima and Naches Rivers; a site, where material, possibly boulders,
suitable for chipped implements had been dug and broken with pebble
hammers, on the north side of the Naches about one mile above its mouth;
pictographs on the basaltic columns on the south side of the Naches River
to the west of the mouth of Cowiche Creek; petroglyphs pecked into basaltic
columns in Selah Canon; ancient house sites on the north side of the Naches
River near its mouth, and on the north side of the Yakima River below the
mouth of the Naches; remains of human cremations, each surrounded by a
circle of rocks on the point to the northwest of the junction of the Naches
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8" name="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>and Yakima Rivers; recent rock-slide graves on the eastern side of the
Yakima River above Union Gap below Old Yakima (Old Town); the
surface along the eastern side of the Yakima River, as far as the vicinity of
Sunnyside; graves in the domes of volcanic ash in the Ahtanum Valley near
Tampico; and rock-slide graves in the Cowiche Valley.</p>

<p>We then moved our base about thirty miles up the Yakima River to
Ellensburg, Mr. Albert A. Argyle examining the surface along the western
side, en route. From Ellensburg, rock-slide graves and human remains,
surrounded by circles of rocks, as well as a village site upon the lowland,
were examined near the mouth of Cherry Creek. A day spent at Clealum
failed to develop anything of archaeological interest in that vicinity, except
that a human skeleton had been removed in the sinking of a shaft for a
coal mine.</p>

<p>From Ellensburg we went to Fort Simcoe by way of North Yakima and
near the Indian Agency observed circles of rocks, like those around the
cremated human remains near North Yakima, and a circular hole surrounded
by a ridge, the remains of an underground house. Crossing the
divide from Ellensburg and going down to Priest Rapids in the Columbia
Valley, no archaeological remains were observed except chips of stone suitable
for chipped implements which were found on the eastern slope of the
divide near the top and apparently marked the place where material for
such implements, probably float quartz, had been quarried. On the western
side of the Columbia, on the flat between Sentinal Bluffs and the river
at the head of Priest Rapids, considerable material was found. This was
on the surface of the beach opposite the bluffs and on a village site near the
head of Priest Rapids. Graves in the rock-slides, back from the river about
opposite this site, were also examined. Some modern graves were noticed
in a low ridge near the river, a short distance above the village site. Crossing
the Columbia, some material was found on the surface of the beach and
further up, petroglyphs pecked in the basaltic rocks at the base of Sentinal
Bluffs were photographed.</p>

<h2><a id="C1" name="C1"></a><span class="smcap">Geographical Description.</span></h2>

<p>Clealum is situated on the Yakima River, at a point on the Northern
Pacific Railway, 122 miles east of the humid, heavily forested coast at Puget
Sound. Although situated not over 154 miles from Copalis, on the ocean
at the western edge or furthest limit of the temperate humid coast country,
the summers are hot and dry and the winters severe. It is 1909 feet above
the sea level and far enough towards the summit of the Cascade Mountains,
that marks the line between the humid coast and the arid almost treeless
interior, to find considerable moisture and many trees.</p>

<p>Ellensburg is situated near the eastern side of the Yakima River, 25 miles
below Clealum, at an altitude of 1512 feet above the sea level and in the wide
somewhat flat Kittitas Valley which was, in former geologic times, a lake
bottom. The river flows rapidly and its low banks at places are high enough
to form gravel bluffs. The surrounding country is arid and there is no
natural forest growth.</p>

<p>Cherry Creek, one of a number of small streams on this side of the river,
flows through the eastern part of this valley, and empties into the Yakima
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>River about one mile below Thrall on Section 31, Town 17, North of Range
19 East. Here, the river enters Yakima Canon which cuts through Umptanum
Ridge and the western foothills of Saddle Mountains. There are
some pines in this canon.</p>

<p>Selah Creek flows through Selah Canon from the east and empties into
the Yakima, about one mile above Selah at the northwest corner of Section
16, Town 14, north of Range 19 East. This is in a broad valley below
Yakima Canon. At the time of our visit, however, the lower portion of
this creek was dry. Wenas Creek empties into the Yakima from the west,
nearly opposite Selah.</p>

<p>North Yakima is on the western side of the Yakima River, about two
miles below the mouth of the Naches, which empties into the Yakima from
the west, immediately below where the latter breaks through Yakima Ridge.
This break is called the Gap or the Upper Gap. North Yakima is at an
altitude of 1067 feet above the sea level. The soil of the valley is made up of
a rich volcanic ash and the region is arid and practically treeless except on
the banks of the rivers and creeks or where irrigation has been successfully
practised. The climate in most respects resembles that of the southern
interior of British Columbia, lying to the north, but in general, there is less
vegetation except on irrigated land.</p>

<p>Cowiche Creek flows from the southwest and empties into the south side
of the Naches, at a point about three miles above its mouth.</p>

<p>Tampico is situated on Section 17, Town 12, north of Range 16 East,
on the north side of Ahtanum Creek, which flows nearly east along the base
of the north side of Rattlesnake Range and empties into the Yakima at
Union Gap or Lower Gap, below Old Yakima.</p>

<p>Fort Simcoe is located in a cluster of live oak trees, on one of the branches
of Simcoe Creek, which flows in an easterly direction and empties into the
Toppenish River, a western feeder of the Yakima. This place is at an
altitude of 937 feet above the sea level and is surrounded by 'scab' land.
Going west from Fort Simcoe, up the slopes of the Cascade Mountains, a
mile or so, one notices timber in the valleys, and as one proceeds still further
up the mountains, the timber becomes thicker and of greater size. This is
the beginning of the forest, which at the west side of the Cascades becomes
so remarkably dense. To the east of Fort Simcoe, however, no trees are
seen, except in the bottoms along the streams, while on the lower reaches of
the Yakima and on the banks of the Columbia, east of here, there are
absolutely no trees.</p>

<p>Kennewick is located on the western side of the Columbia River about
six miles below the mouth of the Yakima. It is opposite Pasco, which is
about three miles above the mouth of Snake River. The place is only 366<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
feet above the sea level and except where irrigation has been practised, there
are no trees in sight, the vegetation being that typical of the desert among
which are sagebrush, grease-wood and cactus. Lewis and Clark, when
here on their way to the Pacific Coast, October 17, 1805,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> saw the Indians
drying salmon on scaffolds for food and fuel. Captain Clark said, "I do
not think [it] at all improbable that those people make use of Dried fish as
fuel. The number of dead Salmon on the Shores &amp; floating in the river
is incrediable to say ... how far they have to raft their timber they make
their scaffolds of I could not learn; but there is no timber of any sort except
Small willow bushes in sight in any direction."</p>

<p>Sentinal Bluffs is the name given to both sides of the gap where the
Columbia River breaks through Saddle Mountains. It is a short distance
above the head of Priest Rapids. Crab Creek empties into the Columbia
from the east on the north side of these mountains. On the western side of
the river, between the Bluffs and the head of Priest Rapids, there is a flat
place of considerable area, portions of which the Columbia floods during
the winter. Going northwest from here to Ellensburg, the trail leads up a
small valley in which are several springs surrounded by some small trees.
One ascends about 2000 feet to the top of the divide and then descends perhaps
1000 feet into the Kittitas Valley.</p>

<h2><a id="C2" name="C2"></a><span class="smcap">Archaeological Sites.</span></h2>

<p>At Clealum, we found no archaeological remains, except a single human
skeleton unearthed in the sinking of a shaft for a coal mine. Here, however,
our examination of the vicinity was limited to one day, and it is possible
that a more thorough search might bring to light archaeological sites. Specimens
from the vicinity of Clealum are unknown to the writer, although there
are a number of collections from the vicinity of Ellensburg, Priest Rapids,
Kennewick and other places lower down. The abundance of specimens on
the surface near Priest Rapids and Kennewick in proportion to those found
near North Yakima and Ellensburg, suggests that the high parts of the valley
were less densely inhabited and that the mountains were perhaps only occasionally
visited. It would seem possible that the prehistoric people of the
Yakima Valley had their permanent homes on the Columbia, and possibly
in the lower parts of the Yakima region. This is indicated by the remains
of underground houses, some of which are as far up as Ellensburg. These
remains are similar to those found in the Thompson River region, where such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>houses were inhabited in the winter. The people of the Yakima area probably
seldom went up to the higher valleys and the mountains, except on
hunting expeditions or to gather berries, roots and wood for their scaffolds,
canoes and other manufactures. If this be correct, it would account for the
scarcity of specimens upon the surface along the higher streams, since all
the hunting parties, berry, root and wood-gathering expeditions were not
likely to leave behind them so much material as would be lost or discarded
in the vicinity of the permanent villages. Spinden states<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that in the Nez
Perce region to the east of the Yakima country, permanent villages were
not built in the uplands, although in a few places where camas and kouse
were abundant, temporary summer camps were constructed.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Ellensburg, we found no archaeological specimens
except the chipped point mentioned on page 163, but this may be due in
part to the modern cultivation of the soil and to the fact that the irrigated
crops, such as are grown here, hide so much of the surface of the ground.
A search along portions of the level country west of the town and even in
such places as those where the river cuts the bank, failed to reveal signs of
house or village sites. In Ellensburg, I saw a summer lodge, made up of a
conical framework of poles covered with cloth and inhabited by an old blind
Indian and his wife. East of the city, near the little stream below the City
Reservoir was another summer lodge made similarly, but among the covering
cloths was some matting of native manufacture. The remains of an
underground house, possibly 30 feet in diameter were seen to the east of
the Northern Pacific Railway, between Ellensburg and Thrall.</p>

<p>On the little bottom land along the western side of Cherry Creek, near
its mouth, at the upper end of Yakima Canon, we found objects which show
that the place had been a camping ground. This is immediately south of
where an east and west road crosses the creek on the farm of Mr. Bull. On
this village site were found the specimens catalogued under numbers 202-8213
to 8222, of which two are shown in <a href="#II">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span></a>, <a href="#f12">Fig. 12</a>, and <a href="#f52">Fig. 52</a>. The
opposite side of this stream strikes one of the foothills of the uplands, the
western extension of Saddle Mountains. On the top of this foothill, which
overlooks the above mentioned village site, were a number of burials marked
by circles of rocks.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In the rock-slide on the side of this hill, between these
circles and the village site below, were a number of graves which are
described in detail under numbers 99-4326-4332 and 202-8223-8258 on
pages 164 to 166. Some of the objects found, many of which are recent
and show contact with the white race, are shown in Figs. <a href="#f71">71a</a>, <a href="#f72">72</a>, <a href="#f74">74</a>, <a href="#f78">78</a>,
<a href="#f80">80</a>, <a href="#f82">82</a>-<a href="#f86">86</a>, <a href="#f90">90</a>, <a href="#f92">92</a>, <a href="#f95">95</a>, and <a href="#f96">96</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>On the western side of the Yakima, about opposite the above mentioned
village site, a rock-slide appears at the head of Yakima Canon. In it are a
number of rock-slide graves marked by sticks.</p>

<p>In Selah Canon, on the north side of Selah Creek, about a mile and a
half above where it empties into the Yakima are three groups of petroglyphs
pecked into the vertical surface of the low basaltic cliffs of the canon wall.
Two of these groups (<a href="#XII">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span></a>) are upon eastern faces of the rock, while
the one shown in <a href="#XIII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span></a>, is upon a southern exposure. In the
rock-slide on the south side of Selah Canon, about three quarters of a mile
above the Yakima or about half way between these petroglyphs and the
Yakima, were found a number of graves, one of them marked by a much
weathered twig. These were the only archaeological remains seen by us in
Selah Canon, although we examined it for at least two miles from its mouth.</p>

<p>On the north slope of Yakima Ridge, near its base, at a point where the
Moxee Canal and the river road turn and run west along the base of the
ridge or about southeast of the largest ranch there, possibly two miles northeasterly
from the Gap, were a number of scattered graves covered with rock-slide
material. About one quarter of a mile west from here, a little west of
south of the ranch, was a large rock-slide, covering a short northerly spur
of the ridge. This is shown from the southwest in <a href="#VII">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span></a>. It is about
three quarters of a mile northeast from where the Yakima River, after flowing
through bottom lands, strikes the base of the Yakima Ridge. In this slide
were a large number of shallow parallel nearly horizontal ditches below each
of which is a low ridge or terrace of the angular slide-rock. Among these
terraces, as shown in <a href="#VII">Fig. 2</a> of the plate, were a few pits surrounded by a low
ridge, made up of jagged slide-rock, apparently from out of the pits. It was
naturally larger at the side of the pit towards the bottom of the slide. In
none of these did we find human remains or specimens. Some of them are
larger than similar pits that we found to be rock-slide graves. Their close resemblance
to graves found to have been disturbed, part of their remains being
scattered near by and to other graves, as they appeared after our excavations,
suggests that these pits are the remains of such rock-slide graves from which
the bodies have been removed by the Indians possibly since the land became
the property of the United States Government. On the other hand, these
pits remind us of rifle pits, though it does not seem probable that they would
be built in such a place for that purpose and there is no local account of the
site having been used for such pits. This rock-slide is particularly interesting
because of the terraces into which most of its surface had been formed.
The character of the rock-slide material is such that one may walk over
these for some little time without noticing them, but once having been noticed,
they always force themselves upon the attention. Standing near the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of the slide, they remind one of rows of seats in a theatre. Each terrace
begins at the edge of the slide and runs horizontally out around its convex
surface to the opposite side. Some of them are wider than others. They
resemble the more or less horizontal and parallel terraces formed by horses
and cattle while feeding on steep slopes. The Yakima Ridge has been so
terraced by stock in many places and over large areas. However, there is
no vegetation on the rock-slide to entice stock and the difficulty of walking
over the cruelly sharp rocks as well as the presence of rattlesnakes would
seem sufficient to cause both cattle and horses to pass either below or above
it. The outer edge of each terrace is probably little lower than the inner
edge, but viewed from the slope it seems so, and this suggests that these
terraces may have been entrenchments, though it would seem that they
would be useless for such a purpose since one can easily reach the land above
from either side. Moreover, it would not seem necessary to make parallel
entrenchments down the entire slope. That they were made to facilitate
the carrying of the dead to the rock-slide graves is possible but not probable.
It seems unlikely that they could have been made for the seating of spectators
to overlook games or ceremonies; for the sharpness of the rocks would
make them very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>There is a much higher rock-slide on the east side of a small steep ravine
near where the Yakima River flows close to the base of the ridge, about
a mile northeast of the Naches River or Upper Gap. Near the top of this
slide, possibly three hundred feet above the river, were similar pits larger
than those just described. Two or three of these were bounded along the
edge towards the top of the slide by an unusually wide terrace. Near the
bottom of this slide were graves<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> (Nos. 1 and 2) which are described in detail
on <a href="#Page_153">page 153</a>. Grave No. 1 was in the base of the rock-slide as shown in the
figure and was indicated by a cedar stick projecting from a slight depression
in the top of the heap of rock-slide material covering it. It was on a slight
terrace about eighty feet above the river, and commanded a view over the
valley of the Yakima to the north. The presence of the brass tube shown
in <a href="#f75">Fig. 75</a> suggests that this grave is not of great antiquity. Grave No. 2
was in the same rock-slide about fifty feet down the ravine or to the north,
and about forty feet above the Moxee flume. It was indicated by a hole in
a pile of rock, like an old well. It was found to contain nothing, the remains
having been removed. On the south side of the Yakima Ridge, near
the bridge over the Yakima, at the Upper Gap, rock-slide graves are said to
have been disturbed during the construction of the flume which carries the
waters of the Moxee ditch around the western end of the Yakima Ridge, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>during the gathering of stone on this point for commercial purposes. Some
of these graves are said to have been above the flume.</p>

<p>Here and there, near the base of the ridge from this point easterly for
about a mile, were found small pits, such as one shown in <a href="#VIII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span></a>.
Apparently, these were rock-slide graves from which the human remains had
been removed, either by the Indians in early times or more recently by visitors
from the neighboring town of North Yakima. Possibly some of them
are old cache holes. One of these graves near the top of a small rock-slide
above the flume contained a human skeleton and is shown in <a href="#VIII">Fig. 2, Plate
<span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span></a>. Below these graves, on the narrow flat between the base of the ridge
and the Yakima River at a point about three quarters of a mile below the
Upper Gap at the mouth of the Naches River, were discovered a number of
small pits each surrounded by a low ridge of earth which were probably the
remains of cache holes made by the Indians during the last twenty years.
On this flat, close to the river were two pits surrounded by a circular ridge
which indicated ancient semi-subterranean house sites, further described
on <a href="#Page_51">page 51</a>.</p>

<p>It is said, that above the flume at a point about a mile and a half below
the Upper Gap, rock-slide graves, some of which were marked by pieces of
canoes were excavated by school boys. The writer was also informed by
small boys that near the top of the ridge immediately above here, they frequently
found chipped points for arrows but on examination discovered
only chips of stone suitable for such points, the boys either having mistaken
the chips for points or having collected so many of the points that they were
scarce.</p>

<p>On the west side of the Yakima, at the Upper Gap, there is a raised flat
top or terrace that overlooks the mouth of the Naches River to the southeast.
Here were a number of circles made up of angular rocks. Within each we
found the remains of human cremations. Unburned fragments of the bones
of several individuals with shell ornaments were often present in a single
circle.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Continuing westward, along the slope of the ridge, cut along its southern
base by the Naches River, at a point about one and a quarter miles west of
the mouth of the river, a small ravine cuts down from the top of the ridge.
This has formed a little flat through the middle of which it has again cut
down towards the river. East of this ravine on the flat is a circle of angular
rocks such as are found scattered over the ridge. This circle no doubt
marks a house site, the interior having been cleared of stone and the circle
of rocks probably having been used to hold down the lodge covering.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>the west of the ravine, where the flat is somewhat higher than to the east,
there are the remains of two semi-subterranean houses. Each of these is
represented by a pit surrounded by a ridge of earth, and on the top, are
large angular rocks.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> At a point where the ridge meets this flat, close to the
western side of the ravine was a slight depression in a small rock-slide which
marked what seemed to be a grave, but which, on excavation, revealed
nothing. Still further westward at a point probably two miles above the
mouth of the Naches River and overlooking the stream at an altitude of perhaps
250 feet, we found scattered over the ground along the eastern summit
of a deep ravine, the first one west of the house sites above mentioned, numerous
small chips of material suitable for chipped implements. These became
more numerous as we proceeded northward up the eastern side of the ravine
for a distance of about a quarter of a mile. Here we came upon the small
quarry in the volcanic soil, shown in <a href="#III">Fig. 1, Plate III</a>. Immediately to the
west of the pit was a pile of earth, apparently excavated from it.</p>

<p>On the top of this heap of soil and among the broken rock to the south
and east of it, were found several water-worn pebbles, used as hammers in
breaking up the rock, as indicated by the battered condition of their ends
(<a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>). We saw no other water-worn pebbles on the surface of the ridge,
but they were numerous in the gravel of the bottom-lands subject to the
overflow of the rivers. It would seem that these pebbles were brought
up from the river below for use as hammers. Scattered to the south of the
pit were found large fragments of float quartz material containing small
pieces of stone suitable for chipped implements but made up mainly of stone
which was badly disintegrated. Lying on the slope of the ravine were many
small fragments of this same stone which were clear of flaws.</p>

<p>It would seem that a mass of float quartz much of which was suitable
for chipped implements had been found here. It had been excavated, leaving
the pile of earth and then broken up with the river pebbles which were
left behind with the waste. Probably there were fairly large pieces of the
material, suitable for chipped implements; that were carried away while
small pieces were left lying about a pile of unsuitable material. In other
words, it would seem that these specimens mark a place for the roughing
out of material for chipped implements.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> On the same side of the river, on
the side of a rather low ridge or table-land overlooking it, at a point about
twelve miles above its mouth, are some rock-slides. Here it is said that
graves have been found. They were probably typical rock-slide graves.
On a point of land perhaps fifty feet above these and a few hundred feet to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17" name="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>the north, Master James McWhirter pointed out a grave on his farm. It
was then surrounded by a ring made up of water-worn pebbles, apparently
brought up from the river. He stated that an attempt had been made to
excavate it which possibly accounts for the pebbles being in a circle rather
than a heap over the grave. This grave was found to contain a slab of wood,
shell ornaments, probably modern, and an adult skeleton, No. 12 (7), 99-4320,
<a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of painted pictographs on the vertical faces of the
basaltic columns, facing north on the south side of the Naches River, immediately
to the west of the mouth of Cowiche Creek. These are below
the flume and may be reached from the top of the talus slope which has been
added to by the blasting away of the rock above, during the construction of
the flume. In fact, debris from this blasting has covered part of the pictographs.
Some of the pictures are in red, others in white and there are
combinations of the two colors.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Local merchants have defaced these

<p>In the Cowiche Valley, there are several rock-slide graves, but these
seem to have been rifled. Northeast of the fair grounds at North Yakima,
the remains of an underground house are said to exist. A short distance
east of Tampico, about 18 miles above the mouth of the Ahtanum, on the
north side of the river and east of the road from the north where it meets
the river road and immediately across it from the house of Mr. Sherman
Eglin, was a grave located in a volcanic dome left by the wind, which Mr.
Eglin pointed out to us. The site is about 600 feet north of the north branch
of the Ahtanum and about fifteen feet above the level of the river. A pile
of rocks about eight feet in diameter covered this grave, No. 25, <a href="#Page_160">p. 160</a>. On
the land of Mr. A. D. Eglin, between the above-mentioned grave and Tampico
on the north side of the road were seen the signs of two graves, destroyed
by plowing. Near here, an oblong mound six or eight inches high and ten
feet wide by eight feet long, supposedly covering a grave, marked by a stone
on the level at each side and each end, 12 and 16 feet apart respectively
was reported by Mr. Eglin's son. A little distance further north and up the
slope of the land, were a number of volcanic ash heaps left by the wind.
The surrounding land is what is locally known as "scab land." In some
of these knolls, graves have been found and one which has been explored is
shown in <a href="#IX">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span></a>. It is located near the pasture gate, and was
marked by a circle of stones as shown in the figure. On excavating, nothing
was found. It is possible that the remains were entirely disintegrated.
Graves in rock-slides on hill sides, and a village site near this place were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>reported by Mr. Eglin's son. Along the north side of Ahtanum Creek
between Ahtanum and Tampico, below the rim rock of the uplands parallel
to the creek are a number of rock-slide graves.</p>

<p>On the western side of Union Gap, through which the Yakima River
flows, below the mouth of Ahtanum Creek, a short distance below Old
Yakima, on a little flat or terrace projecting from the south side of Rattle
Snake Range is a modern Indian cemetery surrounded by a fence. To the
east of Union Gap, on the northwestern slope of Rattle Snake Range, we
examined some rock-slide graves which had been made since the advent of
objects of white manufacture. A mile or so south of Union Gap not far
from the uplands to the east of the river was a ridge of earth extending
north and south nearly parallel with the river road. This, however, I believe
may be the remains of some early irrigation project. On the west side of
the Yakima River about two miles south of Union Gap was seen a summer
lodge made by covering a conical framework with mats.</p>

<p>At Fort Simcoe, immediately south of the Indian agency, on the north
edge of the "scab land," overlooking a small ravine, is a large pit surrounded
by an embankment of earth, the remains of a semi-subterranean house.
Perhaps an eighth of a mile south of this, on higher "scab land" was a
rather low long mound upon which were several piles of stone that probably
marked graves. This mound was lower and more oblong than the usual
dome in which such graves were made. Mrs. Lynch, who pointed these
out has excavated similar piles at this place and found them to mark graves.
We were informed that chipped implements were frequently found along the
Yakima River at a point near Prosser. Above Kennewick, while digging
a flume, a number of graves were discovered, from which Mr. Sonderman
made his collection. Some of these graves contained modern material
(<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>).</p>

<p>On the surface of the western beach of the Columbia at Kennewick and
on the flat land back of it we found chips of material suitable for making
chipped implements, and a large pebble, probably a net sinker.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> These,
together with the fact that Mr. D. W. Owen has also frequently found
specimens here, suggest that this place was an ancient camping ground.
That Lewis and Clark saw Indians here and in the vicinity, as well as that
the Indians still camp here on the beach of the river, sheltered from the wind
by the bank and depending upon the river driftwood for their fuel, strengthens
this suggestion. Specimens have been found on the large island in the
Columbia at the mouth of the Yakima. (See <a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>.) At a point four
miles below Kennewick or perhaps a mile below a point opposite the mouth
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>of the Snake, a grave which contained material of white manufacture is
said to have been discovered by a man while hauling water up the bank of
the Columbia.</p>

<p>Schoolcraft states<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that there was an earthwork on the left bank of the
Lower Yakima on the edge of a terrace about fifteen feet high a short distance
from the water. This terrace was banked on either side by a <a href="#TN">gully</a>.
This consisted of two concentric circles of earth about eighty yards in diameter
by three feet high, with a ditch between. Within were about twenty
"cellars", situated without apparent design, except economy of room. They
were some thirty feet across, and three feet deep. A guide stated that it
was unique and made very long ago by an unknown people. Outside, but
near by, were other "cellars" in no way differing from the remains of villages
of the region. What may be an earthwork near by is described by Schoolcraft<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
as follows: "The Indians also pointed out, near by, a low hill or spur,
which in form might be supposed to resemble an inverted canoe, and which
he had said was a ship." Schoolcraft suggests a possible relation of this to
the mounds of the Sacramento Valley and continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In this connection may also be mentioned a couple of modern fortifications,
erected by the Yakamas upon the Sunkive fork. They are situated between two
small branches, upon the summits of a narrow ridge some two hundred yards long,
and thirty feet in height, and are about twenty-five yards apart. The first is a
square with rounded corners, formed by an earthen embankment capped with stones;
the interstices between which served for loop-holes, and without any ditch. It is
about thirty feet on the sides, and the wall three feet high. The other is built of
adobes, in the form of a rectangle, twenty by thirty-four feet, the walls three feet
high, and twelve to eighteen inches thick, with loop-holes six feet apart. Both are
commanded within rifle-shot by neighboring hills. They were erected in 1847 by
Skloo, as a defence against the Cayuse. We did not hear whether they were successfully
maintained, accounts varying greatly in this respect. In the same neighborhood
Captain M'Clellan's party noticed small piles of stones raised by the Indians
on the edges of the basaltic walls which enclose these valleys, but were informed
that they had no purpose; they were put up through idleness. Similar piles are,
however, sometimes erected to mark the fork of a trail. At points on these walls
there were also many graves, generally made in regular form, covered with loose
stones to protect them from the cayotes, and marked by poles decorated with tin
cups, powder-horns, and articles of dress. During the summer the Indians for the
most part live in the small valleys lying well into the foot of the mountains. These
are, however, uninhabitable during the winter, and they move further down, or to
more sheltered situations. The mission which, in summer, is maintained in the
A-tá-nam valley, is transferred into that of the main river."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>After passing the top of the divide, to the left of the trail from Ellensburg
to Priest Rapids, chips and fragments of variegated float quartz suitable
for chipped implements were found. This apparently marked a place
where a fragment of float rock had been broken up, but fine fragments
were hardly numerous enough to indicate that the place had been a shop
site, or at least a large one. The quantity of material broken up, judging
from the amount of refuse, was small. On the western side of the Columbia,
at the base of the basaltic rocks where they meet the bottom-land, perhaps
a mile from the river were rock-slide graves in the talus slope. At the head
of Priest Rapids, the river turns towards the west and then southward, flowing
close to the southern end of this escarpment. On the flat, at the very
head of Priest Rapids, the river, during high water had washed out the remains
of a village or camp site, where pestles and animal bones were numerous.
A short distance above this, in a low ridge near the river were some
modern graves some of which were marked with sticks at the head and foot.
The bodies, judging from the mounds of earth, were laid full length and
many, if not all of them, judging from the size of the head and foot sticks,
were placed with the feet towards the east. Perhaps a mile above here near
the home of Mr. Britain Everette Craig, several large and deep pits, the
sites of ancient semi-subterranean houses were seen. Above and near his
house, the river had washed out what was apparently a village site, and
perhaps a few graves. Here was found the small fresh water shell heap,
shown in <a href="#V">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span></a>, and the pile of flat oval pebbles which probably
marked a cooking place, shown in Fig. 2. On the west beach of the
Columbia at Sentinal Bluffs perhaps another mile further up the river,
notched sinkers and other indications of a camp or fishing ground were
found.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the river near the head of Priest Rapids some
material was found on the surface of the beach where the floods of the river
had uncovered it. A mile or more above here, pecked on the basaltic
columns of Sentinal Bluffs, which may be seen in both figures of <a href="#V">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span></a>
were a number of petroglyphs, shown in <a href="#XI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span></a> and described on <a href="#f121">page 121</a>.
Those shown in Fig. 1, photographed from the west, are on the columns to
the east of the road, blasted through the rocks at this point, and perhaps
fifteen feet from the river. Those in Fig. 2, photographed from the north,
are to the west of the road on the columns which rise abruptly from the river.
Some specimens and indications of habitation were found scattered between
this point and the mouth of Crab Creek, the bed of which was dry in most
places when we visited it.</p>

<h2><a id="C3" name="C3"></a><span class="smcap">Resources.</span></h2>

<p>The resources of the prehistoric people of the Yakima Valley, as indicated
by the specimens found in the graves and about the village sites, were
chiefly of stone, copper, shell, bone, antler, horn, feathers, skin, tule stalks,
birch bark and wood. They employed extensively various kinds of stone
for making a variety of objects. Obsidian,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> glassy basalt or trap, petrified
wood, agate, chalcedonic quartz with opaline intrusions, chert and jasper
were used for chipping into various kinds of points, such as those used for
arrows, spears, knives, drills and scrapers. According to Spinden,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> obsidian
was used in the Nez Perce region to the east where it was obtained from the
John Day River and in the mountains to the east, possibly in the vicinity of
the Yellowstone National Park. The people of the Yakima Valley may have
secured it from the Nez Perce. As on the coast, objects made of glassy
basalt were rare here, although it will be remembered that they were the
most common among chipped objects in the Thompson River region.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Mr.
James Teit believes that glassy basalt is scarce in the Yakima region and that
this is the reason why the prehistoric people there did not use it extensively.
Some agate, chalcedony and similar materials were used in the Thompson
River region, but while there is a great quantity of the raw material of these
substances there, the Indians say that the black basalt was easier to work
and quite as effective when finished. Several small quarries of float quartz
had been excavated and broken up to be flaked at adjacent work shops,
<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>. River pebbles were made into net sinkers, pestles, mortars, hammerstones,
scrapers, clubs, slave killers, sculptures, and similar objects,
and were also used for covering some of the graves in the knolls. Serpentine
was used for celts and clubs; lava for sculptures. Slate was used for ornamental
or ceremonial tablets steatite for ornaments and pipes, though rarely
for pestles and other objects; and impure limestone for pipes. Fragments
of basaltic rock were used for covering graves in the rock-slides and in some
of the knolls. Places on the basaltic columns and cliffs served as backgrounds
upon which pictures were made, some being pecked,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> others painted.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> No
objects made of mica or nephrite were found. Siliceous sandstone was made
into pestles, pipes and smoothers for arrow-shafts, but the last were rare.
Copper clay, white earth and red ochre were not found, but red and white
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22" name="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>paint were seen on the basaltic cliffs and Mrs. Lynch reports blue paint
from a grave near Fort Simcoe (<a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>).</p>

<p>Copper was used for beads, pendants and bracelets. While all of this
copper may have been obtained by barter from the whites, yet some of it
may have been native. Copper, according to Spinden, was probably not
known to the Nez Perce before the articles of civilization had reached that
region, but he states that large quantities of copper have been taken from
graves and that the edges of some of the specimens are uneven, such as
would be more likely to result from beating out a nugget than from working
a piece of cut sheet copper.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The glass beads, iron bracelets,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and bangles,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
the brass rolled beads,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> brass pendant<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and the white metal inlay,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> which
we found, all came from trade with the white race during recent times
and do not belong to the old culture.</p>

<p>Shells of the fresh water unio, in a bed five or six feet in diameter and
two or three inches thick, at the Priest Rapids village site and described on
<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a> indicate that this animal had been used for food. Shells of the little
salt water clam (<i>Pectunculus</i> 202-8388, <a href="#f88">Fig. 88</a>), haliotis (202-8234b, 8252,
8255, 8386, <a href="#f89">Figs. 89-92</a>), dentalium (202-8178, 8156, 8163, 8173, 8177-9,
8184, 8186-89, 8192-3, 8233, 8241, 8253, 8389, Figs. <a href="#f74">74</a>, <a href="#f117">117</a>, and <a href="#f118">118</a>)
olivella (202-8393, <a href="#f87">Fig. 87</a>), and oyster (202-8170, <a href="#f94">Fig. 94</a>) which were
made into various ornaments must have been obtained from the coast. No
shells of <i>Pecten caurinus</i> were found.</p>

<p>Deer bones were seen in great numbers in the earth of a village site at the
head of Priest Rapids where they probably are the remains of cooking.
Animal bones were made into points for arrows or harpoon barbs, awls and
tubes that were probably used in gambling. Fish bones (202-8387) found
in the village sites suggest that fish were used for food. No bones of the
whale were found.</p>

<p>Antler was used for wedges, combs and as material upon which to carve.
Horns of the Rocky Mountain sheep were used for digging-stick handles.
Mountain sheep horns were secured by the Nez Perce who lived to the east
of the Yakima region, and were traded with Indians westward as far as the
Lower Columbia.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> No objects made of teeth were found although a piece
of a beaver tooth (202-8189) was seen in grave No. 21, and Mrs. Lynch
reports elk teeth from a grave near Fort Simcoe (<a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>). Pieces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>thong, skin, fur, and feathers of the woodpecker, all of which were probably
used as articles of wearing apparel, were found in the graves preserved by
the action of copper salts or the dryness of the climate.</p>

<p>Wood was used as the hearth of a fire drill<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and for a bow, a fragment
of which is shown in <a href="#f114">Fig. 114</a>. Sticks which had not decayed in this dry
climate, marked some of the graves in the rock-slides (<a href="#Page_140">p. 140</a>). Charcoal
was also found in the graves and village sites. A fragment of birch bark,
tightly rolled (202-8392) was found in a grave; roots were woven into
baskets;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> rushes were stitched and woven into mats.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><a id="C5" name="C5"></a><i>Points Chipped out of Stone.</i> Many implements used in procuring food
were found. In general, they are similar in character to those found in the
Thompson River Region.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The most numerous perhaps, were points of
various sizes and shapes, made by chipping and flaking, for arrows, knives
and spears. Many of these are small and finely wrought and most of them
are of bright colored agates, chalcedonies and similar stones. As before
mentioned, several small quarries of such material with adjacent workshops
were found. A very few specimens were made of glassy basalt, and it will
be remembered (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>) that this was the prevailing material for chipped
implements in the Thompson River region to the north, where there was
perhaps not such a great variety of material used.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In the Nez Perce region
to the east, according to Spinden, a great variety of forms of arrow points
chipped from stone of many kinds is found,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and the extreme minuteness of
some of them is noteworthy. The war spear sometimes had a point of stone,
usually lance-shaped, but sometimes barbed.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> He further states that iron
supplanted flint and obsidian at an early date, for the manufacture of arrow-heads.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>No caches of chipped implements were found in the Yakima region.
Judging from the collections which I have seen, I am under the impression
that chipped points are not nearly so numerous in this region as they are
near The Dalles and in the Columbia Valley immediately south of this area,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>and perhaps not even as numerous as in the Thompson River country to the
north. We found no fantastic forms such as were rather common in the
Thompson River country.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> It will be remembered<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> that the art of chipping
stone was not extensively practised on the coast of British Columbia or
Washington, no specimens having been found in that area north of Vancouver
Island except at Bella Coola, where only two were discovered. They
were frequent at Saanich and in the Fraser Delta and became still more
common as one approached the mouth of the Columbia on the west coast of
Washington where, on the whole, they seem to resemble, especially in the
general character of the material, the chipped points of the Columbia River
Valley in the general region from Portland to The Dalles.</p>

<p>The range of forms and sizes is well shown in Figs. 1 to 6 and in <a href="#I">Plates
<span class="smcap lowercase">I</span></a> and <a href="#II"><span class="smcap lowercase">II</span></a>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The specimen shown in <a href="#f1">Fig. 1</a> is very small, apparently made
from a thin flake of chalcedony that has not been much chipped. Its edges
are slightly serrated and it was found on the surface near
the head of Priest Rapids. Deeply serrated points are
found in the Nez Perce region to the east, but they are
unusual.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The one shown in <a href="#f2">Fig. 2</a> is also made of
chalcedony and is from the same place. It is larger and
the barbs are not so deep. The specimen shown in <a href="#f3">Fig.
3</a>, chipped from white chalcedony was found at the
same place and may be considered as a knife point
rather than as an arrow point. The one shown in <a href="#f3">Fig.
4</a> is made of petrified wood and has serrated edges.
It was found at Priest Rapids and is in the collection of Mr. Mires.
<a href="#f5">Fig. 5</a> illustrates a point with a straight base chipped from obsidian,
one of the few made of this material that have been found in the whole
region. This is also from Priest Rapids in the collection of Mr. Mires.
The straight based arrow-head is very common in the Nez Perce region.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
The specimen shown in <a href="#f6">Fig. 6</a> is leaf shaped, the base being broken off. It
is made of chert, was collected at Wallula near the Columbia River in Oregon
by Judge James Kennedy in 1882 and is in the James Terry collection of
this Museum. <a href="#I">Plate I</a> shows a rather large and crudely chipped point made
of basalt, from the surface near the head of Priest Rapids on the bank of the
Columbia River. The second is made of red jasper and the third of white
chert. They were found near the head of Priest Rapids, the latter also on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the bank of the river. These three specimens may be considered as finished
or unfinished spear or knife points. The specimens shown in <a href="#II">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span></a> are
more nearly of the average size. The first is made of buff jasper and was
found on the surface at Kennewick. It is slightly serrated. The second is
made of brownish fissile jasper and was found in grave No. 10 (5) in a rock-slide
near the mouth of the Naches River. The third, chipped from mottled
quartz was found in grave No. 28 (21) near the skull in a rock-slide about
three miles west of the mouth of Cowiche Creek. The fourth of white quartzite
is also from grave No. 28 (21) near the skull. The breadth of the base
of these last two specimens and the notches would facilitate their being
fastened very securely in an arrow-shaft, while the basal points would
probably project far enough beyond the shaft to make serviceable barbs.
The fifth specimen, chipped from brown chert was found among the refuse
of a fire in grave No. 1, in a rock-slide of the Yakima Ridge. The sixth
is made of glassy basalt and is remarkable for having two sets of notches.
It is rather large, which suggests that it may have served as a knife point.
It is from the head of Priest Rapids and was collected and presented by Mrs.
J. B. Davidson. Double notched arrow points are found in the Nez
Perce region.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The seventh is chipped from pale fulvous chalcedony and
is from the surface at the same place. The eighth is chipped from similar
material and was found near by. The ninth is made of opaline whitish
chalcedony and is from the same place. The tenth is chipped from yellow
agate, and somewhat resembles a drill, while the eleventh is of brown horn
stone, both of them being from the surface near the head of Priest Rapids.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>The twelfth which is chipped from clove brown jasper was found on the
surface of the Cherry Creek camp site near Ellensburg. The thirteenth is
made of reddish white chert and was found on the surface near the mouth
of Wenas Creek. The fourteenth is of pale yellow chalcedony and comes
from the surface near the head of Priest Rapids. Most of these specimens
seem to be suitable for arrow points, although some of them probably served
for use as knives.</p>

<p><a id="C6" name="C6"></a><i>Points Rubbed out of Stone.</i> No points rubbed out of stone have been
found in this region, although it will be remembered that two such points
were found in the Thompson River region<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and were thought to represent
an intrusion from the coast where they were common as in the Fraser Delta<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
at both Port Hammond and Eburne where they are more than one half as
numerous as the chipped points, and at Comox<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> where at least seven of this
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>type to three chipped from stone were found. They were also found at
Saanich,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> where they were in proportion of nineteen to twenty-four, near
Victoria<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and on the San Juan Islands.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><a id="C7" name="C7"></a><i>Points Rubbed out of Bone.</i> Points rubbed out of bone which were so
common on the coast everywhere, but rare in the Thompson River country
are still more scarce here. Only ten specimens from the whole region can be
identified as clearly intended for the points or barbs of arrows, harpoon heads
or spears. The types are shown in <a href="#f7">Figs. 7 to 12</a>. The first was found in the
west, northwest part of grave No. 10 (5) in a rock-slide about a half mile
above the mouth of the Naches River. It is nearly circular in cross section,
31 mm. long with a point only 6 mm. in length and was apparently intended
for a salmon harpoon head, similar to those used in the Thompson River
region<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
both in ancient and modern times but which are much more common
on the coast. The specimen shown in <a href="#f8">Fig. 8</a> is circular in cross section
and was seen in the collection of Mrs. Davidson. It is from Kennewick
and is of the shape of one of the most frequent types of bone points found in
the Fraser Delta.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
The specimen shown in <a href="#f9">Fig. 9</a> was found with three
others in grave No. 1 in a rock-slide of the Yakima Ridge. This and two
of the others were scorched. They are circular in cross section and sharp
at both ends but the upper end is much the more slender. The point shown
in <a href="#f10">Fig. 10</a> somewhat resembles these, but it is slightly larger and tends to be
rectangular in cross section except at the base. It was found with a similar
specimen in a grave on the Snake River, five miles above its mouth, and was
collected and presented by Mr. Owen who still has the other specimen.
Diagonal striations may still be seen on its much weathered brown surface.
These were probably caused by rubbing it on a stone in its manufacture.
A slightly different type of bone point is shown in Figs. <a href="#f11">11</a> and <a href="#f12">12</a>. These
seem to be barbs for fish spears such as were found in the Thompson River
region,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
among both ancient and modern specimens. The one shown in
<a href="#f11">Fig. 11</a> has traces of the marrow canal on the reverse. It was found in the
Yakima Valley below Prosser and is in the collection of Mr. Spalding. While
the specimen shown in <a href="#f12">Fig. 12</a> is from the surface near the head of Priest
Rapids.</p>

<p>Bone points and barbs were used in the Nez Perce region to the east,
where three types of spears with bone points were known, two of them at
least being similar to those found in the Thompson River region to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
north.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The war spears sometimes had a point of bone, usually lance-shaped,
but sometimes barbed.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><a id="C8" name="C8"></a><i>Bows.</i> The only information which we have regarding bows is from the
specimen shown in <a href="#f114">Fig. 114</a>. The object seems to be a fragment of a bow
which was lenticular in cross section although rather flat. It is slightly bent
and the concave side bears transverse incisions. (<a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>.) The specimen
was found in grave No. 10 (5) in a rock-slide about one hundred and fifty
feet up the slope on the north side of the Naches River, about half a mile
above its mouth. The presence of several perishable objects in the grave
suggest it to be modern, but no objects of white manufacture were found.
This is the only object indicating the sort of bow used in this region and
with the exception of the chipped points previously described, some of which
were undoubtedly for arrows, is the only archaeological object tending to
prove the use of the bow. It will be remembered<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> that fragments of a bow
of lenticular cross section ornamented with parallel irregularly arranged
cuneiform incisions, were found in a grave near Nicola Lake in the Thompson
River region and that pieces of wood, some of which may have been part
of a bow, were found in a grave at the mouth of Nicola Lake; also that pieces
of wood found at Kamloops resemble a bow of the type shown in Fig. 220
of Mr. Teit's paper on the present Thompson Indians.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>In the Nez Perce region to the east, war clubs with heads made of unworked
river boulders, according to Spinden,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> were sometimes used in
killing game and such may have been the case in this region.</p>

<p><a id="C9" name="C9"></a><i>Snares.</i> Fragments of thongs, skin, fur and woodpecker feathers
merely suggest methods of hunting or trapping which are not proven by any
of our finds. It is barely possible although not probable that the bone tubes
considered to have been used in gambling and illustrated in <a href="#f97">Figs. 97 and 98</a>
and also the perforated cylinder of serpentine shown in <a href="#f97">Fig. 99</a> may be
portions of snares. Traps and snares of various kinds were common among
the Indians of the larger plateau area of which this is a part.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Mr. J. S. Cotton informs me that in the vicinity of Mr. Turner's home,
Section 6, Town north 18, Range 40 east, on Rock Creek, about six miles
below Rock Lake, and in the vicinity of the graves described on <a href="#Page_140">p. 140</a> and
the so-called fort mentioned on <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>, there is a long line of stones running
from Rock Creek in a southeasterly direction across the coule to a small draw
on the other side. This chain of rocks is about five miles long. The stones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>have evidently sunk into the ground and show signs of having been there a
long time. They have been in the same condition since about 1874 when first
seen by the whites, even the oldest Indians claiming to know nothing about
them. According to Lewis, game was surrounded and driven in by a large
number of hunters or was run down by horses, in the great area of which
this is part.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It seems altogether probable that a line of stone heaps may
have been made to serve either as a line of scarecrows, possibly to support
flags or similar objects, which would have the effect of a fence to direct the
flight of the game or as a guide to enable the hunters to drive the game
towards a precipice where it would be killed, or a corral where it would be
impounded.</p>

<p><a id="C10" name="C10"></a><i>Notched Sinkers.</i> Sinkers for fish nets or lines were made of disk-shaped
river pebbles. A pebble and the different types of sinkers are shown in <a href="#f13">Fig.
13</a>. These were numerous on the surface of the beach of the Columbia
River near the head of Priest Rapids. They have two or four notches chipped
from each side in the edges. When there are two, the notches are usually
at each end; when there are four, they are at the end and side edges. Sometimes,
the notches are so crudely made that the edge of the pebble is simply
roughened so that a string tied about it at this place would hold. One of
these sinkers from Priest Rapids was seen in Mr. Mires' collection.</p>

<p><a id="C11" name="C11"></a><i>Grooved Sinkers.</i> Some large thick pebbles have grooves pecked around
their shortest circumference. They may have been used as canoe smashers
or anchors, but seem more likely to be net sinkers. Two of these are shown
in Figs. <a href="#f14">14</a> and <a href="#f15">15</a>. They are from Priest Rapids and are in the collection
of Mr. Mires. Both are battered along the lower edge, from the groove on
the left to within a very short distance of it on the right and over a considerable
portion of the edge of the top. In the second specimen, this battering
forms a considerable groove on the lower edge, but a groove only the size of
those shown in the illustration on the upper edge. This battering suggests
that they may have been used as hammers, but the battered ends of hammers
are not often grooved. There are certain grooves pecked on one side of each
which seem to be of a decorative or ceremonial significance and are consequently
discussed on <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a> under the section devoted to art. The first
specimen is made of granite or yellow quartzite with mica, the second is of
granite or yellowish gray quartz with augite and feldspar. One specimen
similar to these two, but without any decoration or grooving (202-8116) was
found by us on the beach at Kennewick as was also a large pebble grooved
nearly around the shortest circumference (202-8332) at Priest Rapids.
One object of this type made of a boulder but grooved around the longest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a><br />[Pg 32]</span>
circumference was seen in Mr. Owen's collection. It was found on the bank
of the Columbia River two miles below Pasco. The specimen described on
<a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a> which has a notch pecked in each side edge and is battered slightly
on one end may have been used as a net sinker, although it has been considered
a hammer. This specimen (202-8214) in a way resembles the small
flat notched sinkers except that the notch is pecked instead of chipped and
that it is larger and thicker in proportion. Other specimens which are
considered as net sinkers, anchors or "canoe smashers" instead of being
grooved, are perforated by a hole which tapers from each side and has
apparently been made by pecking. Sometimes this hole is in the center,
while in other cases it passes through one end. <a href="#f16">Fig. 16</a> illustrates such a
specimen. It was found at Priest Rapids and is in the collection of Mr.
Mires. It is made from a river pebble of yellowish-gray volcanic rock.
The perforation is in the broadest end. A similar specimen perforated near
one end and one pierced near the middle were seen in Mr. Owen's collection.
He believes that these were used for killing fish, an Indian having told him
that such stones were thrown at the fish and retrieved with a cord which was
tied through the hole. Probably all of these were sinkers for nets or at least
anchors for the ends of nets, set lines or for small boats.</p>

<p>Sinkers were not seen by us among archaeological finds in the Thompson
River region but Mr. James Teit has informed the writer of their use there
on both nets and lines, particularly on the former. Nets, excepting the bag
net, were very little used in the Kamloops-Lytton region along the Thompson
River and that may account for a scarcity of sinkers among archaeological
finds. Nets were more extensively used on the Fraser River, but were very
much used near large lakes and consequently one would expect to find sinkers
in the vicinity of such places as Kamloops, Shushwap, Anderson, Seaton,
Lillooet, Nicola, Kootenay and Arrow Lakes. Now, as the Shushwap generally
made little bags of netting in which they put their sinkers to attach
them to nets, this would greatly militate against the finding of grooved,
notched or perforated sinkers in the Shushwap part of this region. They
probably thought this method was more effective or took up less time than
notching, grooving or perforating stones, and attaching lines to them. It is
unknown which of these methods is the most primitive. Unworked pebbles,
chosen for their special adaptation in shape, and others grooved or perforated
were used in some parts of the interior of British Columbia for sinkers
which were not enclosed in netting. Unworked pebbles attached to
lines have been seen in use among the Thompson River Indians by Mr.
Teit who sent a specimen of one to the Museum.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> These were of various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a><br /><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
shapes, some of them being egg-shaped. A deeply notched oval pebble
was found on the site of an old semi-subterranean winter house on the west
side of Fraser River at the month of Churn Creek in the country of the
Fraser River division of the Shushwap. The Thompson Indians said it
had been intended for a war ax and accordingly one of them mounted it in a
handle. It is now cat. No. 16-9073 in this Museum. Mr. Teit believes the
stone to be too heavy for a war club of any kind and that possibly it may
originally have been a sinker, although it is chipped more than necessary
for the latter. In 1908, he saw a perforated sinker found near the outlet of
Kootenay Lake, on the borders of the Lake division of the Colville tribe and
the Flat-bow or Kootenay Lake branch of the Kootenay tribe. It was
made of a smooth flat water-worn beach pebble 132 mm. long by 75 mm. wide
and 25 mm. thick. The perforation was drilled from both sides near the
slightly narrower end and a groove extended from it over the nearest end
where it formed a notch somewhat deeper than the groove. Mr. Teit heard
that several such sinkers had been picked up around Kootenay Lake and
also along the Arrow Lakes of the Columbia River on the borders of the
Shushwap and Lake divisions of the Colville tribe.</p>

<p>In the Nez Perce region<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> to the east, no sinkers were used with fish lines,
but roughly grooved river boulders were employed as net sinkers.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> A grooved
sinker has been found at Comox, grooved stones which may have been used
as sinkers occur at Saanich, on the west coast of Washington and the lower
Columbia. On the coast of Washington some of them have a second
groove at right angles to the first which in some cases extends only half way
around; that is, from the first groove over one end to meet the groove on the
opposite side. One of the specimens found at Saanich was of this general
type. Perforated specimens have been found in the Fraser Delta,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> at
Comox,[72] at Saanich,[72] Point Gray,[72] Marietta,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> at Gray's Harbor and in the
Lower Columbia Valley. On the whole, however, sinkers are much more
numerous in the Yakima region than on the Coast. The fish bones which
were found, as mentioned under resources, tend to corroborate the theory
that the notched, grooved and perforated pebbles were net sinkers and that
the bone barbs were for harpoons used in fishing.</p>

<p><a id="C12" name="C12"></a><i>Shell Heaps.</i> Small heaps of fresh water clam shells, as before mentioned
among the resources of the region on <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>, were seen; but these
being only about five feet in diameter and two or three inches thick are hardly
comparable to the immense shell heaps of the coast. These fresh water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>shells were probably secured from the river near by, where such mollusks
now live. Shell fish probably formed only a small part of the diet of the
people although dried sea clams may have been secured from the coast by
bartering. The objects made of sea shell mentioned among the resources
of this region as probably secured from the coast through channels of trade,
suggest that the same method was employed for obtaining certain food
products from a distance. In fact, Lewis and Clark inform us that the
tribes of this general region carried on considerable trade with those of the
lower Columbia. Shell heaps of this character, however, are found in the
Nez Perce region. Spinden<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> states that no shell heaps except of very small
size are found, but occasionally those of a cubic foot or more in size are seen
in the loamy banks of the rivers, noting a few near the junction of the South
and Middle forks of Clearwater River, and also near the confluence of the
North fork with the Clearwater. These seem to be the remains of single
meals that had been buried or cast into holes.</p>

<p><a id="C13" name="C13"></a><i>Digging Sticks.</i> The gathering of roots is suggested by the presence of
digging stick handles. One of these (<a href="#f126">Fig. 126</a>) is made of the horn of a
rocky mountain sheep and was secured from an Indian woman living near
Union Gap below Old Yakima. The perforation, near the middle of one
side for the reception of the end of the digging stick, is nearly square but
has bulging sides and rounded corners. The smaller end of the object is
carved, apparently to represent the head of an animal. Similar handles,
some of them of wood, others of antler and with perforations of the same
shape, were seen in Mr. Janeck's collection. It will be remembered that
such digging stick handles made of antler were found in the Thompson
River region among both archaeological finds and living natives,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the archaeological
specimens being of antler, the modern handles of wood or horn.</p>

<p>The digging stick was one of the most necessary and characteristic implements
of the Nez Perce region to the east, the handle consisting of a piece
of bone or horn perforated in the middle for the reception of the end of the
digging stick, or, according to Spinden, an oblong stone with a transverse
groove in the middle lashed at right angles to the stick.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> No archaeological

coast.</p>

<p><a id="C14" name="C14"></a><i>Basketry.</i> The gathering of berries as well as of roots is suggested by
fragments of baskets which have been found. One of these is shown in <a href="#f17">Fig. 17</a>.
It was found in grave No. 10 (5) in a rock-slide about
a half mile above the mouth of the Naches River.
It is coiled with splint foundation and bifurcated
stitch. Judging from other baskets of the same
kind, it was probably once imbricated. This type
of basketry is widely distributed towards the north
and with grass foundation is even found in Siberia.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Commonly the coiled basketry in the Nez Perce
region to the east was made with bifurcated stitch,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
by means of a sharpened awl which was the only
instrument used in weaving it. Some were imbricated,
although this style has not been made for
many years, and only a few of the older natives
remember women who could make them.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Some similar basketry of a
finer technique was found with this fragment.</p>

<p><a id="C16" name="C16"></a><i>Mortars.</i> Mortars made of stone for crushing food, such as dried salmon,
other meat and berries, were not uncommon in this region and pestles of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>the surface of a village site on the west bank of the Columbia at the head of
Priest Rapids, and were probably used as lap stones or as objects upon which
to crush food. A somewhat circular one (202-8295) about 230 mm. in
diameter has a notch, formed by chipping from one side, opposite one naturally
water-worn, which suggests that it may have been used as a sinker; but
it seems more likely that it was simply an anvil or lap stone. Similar pebbles

<p>A somewhat disk-shaped pebble of gray lava 295 mm. in diameter with a
saucer-shaped depression in the top and a large pecked pit in the bottom
(20.0-3344) was collected at Fort Simcoe by Dr. H. J. Spinden. A fragment

base and a depression 50 mm. deep in the top (202-8293) was found on the
surface near the head of Priest Rapids and another fragment nearly twice as
large, the base of which is concave over most of its surface and shows marks
of pecking, apparently the result of an attempt to make it either quite flat
or concave like many other mortars that have a concavity in each side, is
shown in <a href="#f18">Fig. 18</a>. It was found among the covering boulders of the grave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>of an adult, No. 42(4), in the sand at the western edge of the Columbia River
about twelve miles above the head of Priest Rapids. The mortar shown in

Gap and is in the collection of Mr. Janeck.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This reminds us of a similar

<p>The specimen shown in <a href="#f116">Fig. 116</a>,
which may be considered as a dish
rather than a mortar, was seen in the
collection of Mrs. Hinman who obtained
it from Priest Rapids. It is apparently
of sandstone, 150 mm. in diameter, 50
mm. high, the upper part being 38 mm.
high and of disk shape with slightly bulging sides which are decorated with
incised lines,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> the lower part being also roughly disk shaped 64 mm. by 76
mm. in diameter by about 12 mm. high with slightly convex bottom and
edges curved out to the base of the upper part. There is a disk shaped dish
in the top 100 mm. in diameter by 12 mm. in depth.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The animal form shown in <a href="#f125">Fig. 125</a> bears a mortar or dish in its back.
The object is 203 mm. in length, 88 mm. high and 113 mm. wide. The
length of the bowl is 88 mm., the width 70 mm., and the depth 38 mm.
The object is made of porous lava and was secured from an Indian who
claimed to have found it in a grave near Fort Simcoe on the Yakima Reservation
two miles below Union Gap which is immediately below Old Yakima.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>It seems strange that so many of the mortars are broken since they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>be hard to break. It will be remembered that one of the broken mortars
came from a grave and it may be that the others were on or in graves but
had been removed in some way. My general impression is that mortars
are much more numerous among archaeological finds both in this region and
in the interior of British Columbia than on the coast.</p>

<p><a id="C17" name="C17"></a><i>Pestles.</i> In addition to the probable use of pestles with flat stones or
mortars with basket funnels, some of them, especially where nearly flat or
concave on the striking head as in the Thompson River region to the north
and on the coast may also have been used as hammers for driving wedges,
splitting wood and like industries, if indeed they were not made solely for
the latter uses. Some of the pestles differ from those found either to the
north or on the coast, many of them being much longer, although Mr.
James Teit informs me that very long pestles are occasionally found in the
Thompson River region. He has seen four, and heard of one or two more.
One two feet long was found in the Nicola Valley about 1905. One of the
pestles of the Yakima Valley has a top in the form of an animal hoof, as is
shown in <a href="#f124">Fig. 124</a>. Others like animal heads are shown in Figs. <a href="#f31">31</a>, <a href="#f33">33</a>-<a href="#f35">35</a>.
The range of forms of pestles is shown in Figs. <a href="#f21">21</a> to <a href="#f35">35</a>. The specimens
shown in Figs. <a href="#f22">22</a> to <a href="#f28">28</a> inclusive are apparently all of the shorter type,
while those shown in the remaining figures are variations of the longer type.
By far the greater number of pestles, about forty, are of the type shown in
<a href="#f21">Fig. 21</a>, and of these two thirds come from the vicinity of Priest Rapids.
They are merely natural pebbles, all more or less of suitable size, shape and
material, which have been used as pestles until one end has become flattened.
Some of them are also flattened on the top, the battered ends often giving
the only indication that they were used. Such as were not of exactly the
right form for grasping have had their excrescences or the more projecting
surfaces removed by pecking. A few of these objects seem to have been
made from small basaltic columns, the corners of which have been pecked
into a more suitable shape. Some of them have been pecked so that they
taper gradually from the small upper end to the base. The specimen considered
as a "slave-killer" and shown in <a href="#f69">Fig. 69</a>, may have been used as a
pestle. Simple short cylindrical or conoid pebbles, only slightly changed
from their natural form, are used for pestles in the Nez Perce region to the
east.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>A pebble 559 mm. long by 152 mm. wide and 114 mm. thick, with
rounded corners and ends, found by Mr. John Lacy near the Yakima River
in North Yakima, has longitudinal grooves pecked in three sides to where
they begin to round over to form the end, and a similar groove, except that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
it is only about 101 mm. long, in the middle of the fourth side.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> These
grooves were probably made as part of a process of grooving and battering
down the intervening ridges in order to bring the specimen into a desired
form. Similarly grooved pebbles found on the northern part of Vancouver
Island were explained to Professor Franz Boas as having been implements
in such process of manufacture. So far as I am aware, Prof. Boas' announcement
of this at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science was the first explanation of the sort of grooving or fluting of specimens
found in northwestern America. One similar large specimen (20.0-3343)
found at Lewiston, Idaho, in the Nez Perce region by Dr. H. J. Spinden,
bears two longitudinally pecked grooves in addition to pecking on much
of its surface. A yellowish gray boulder about 349 mm. long, nearly circular
in sections and with rounded ends, from Priest Rapids, bears a pecked
groove 82 mm. long by 31 mm. wide and 6 mm. deep across the middle of
one side. This may have been made to cut it into the length desired for
a pestle.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This specimen is much too large to be considered as the handle
of a digging stick, similar to the object from the Nez Perce region considered
as such by Spinden.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The object shown in <a href="#f22">Fig. 22</a>, one of those from the surface near the head
of Priest Rapids, judging from the battered end, has apparently been used as
a pestle, yet it is still apparently in process of manufacture into a form somewhat
like that shown in <a href="#f27">Fig. 27</a>. The pecking at the top is possibly the
result of an attempt to remove that portion of the rock, while the transversely
pecked surface seems to be a beginning towards the formation of the shaft
of the pestle, whereas the longitudinal groove between these two surfaces was
necessary to reduce an excrescence on the rim of what was apparently intended
to be the knob at the top of the pestle. If this supposition be true, when
finished, this object would have a large striking head resembling more in
shape and size those of the pestles of the region near The Dalles than any
yet found in this region. The specimen shown in <a href="#f23">Fig. 23</a> is much more
clearly an unfinished pestle. The ends are pecked flat and the entire middle
section has been pecked, apparently to reduce it to the desired size of the
shaft. It seems that the striking head of this specimen, when finished,
would be rather short. It was found on the surface eight miles above the
head of Priest Rapids.</p>

<p>The pestle shown in <a href="#f24">Fig. 24</a> has a conoid body with no striking head and
in this respect resembles the pestles of the Thompson River country;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>the top is roughly disk-shaped, being neither hat-shaped nor in the form of
an animal head, as are most pestles of the Thompson region nor is it exactly
of the shape of the typical pestles of northern and western Vancouver Island.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
The material is a soft gray stone which shows the marks of the pecking by
means of which it was shaped.</p>

<p><a href="#f25">Fig. 25</a> illustrates a pestle, the top of which is broken off. There are
two grooves encircling the somewhat cylindrical striking head. The material
is a light blue hard porphoritic rock. These two specimens are from Priest
Rapids.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The pestle shown in <a href="#f26">Fig. 26</a> is from the Yakima River, five miles
below Old Yakima. It has a hat-shaped top and a cylindrical striking head
a little larger at the top than at the bottom, is somewhat like the typical
pestles of the Thompson River region,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and is in the collection of Mr. York.
Another has a slightly wider brim to the hat-shaped top, a body concave in
outline and the striking head is larger at the top than at the bottom, while a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>third has a medium sized brim, a body bulging in the middle and a long
cylindrical striking head. The last two specimens are in the collection of
Mr. Janeck, and are from the Yakima Valley within eight miles of North
Yakima.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The specimen shown in <a href="#f27">Fig. 27</a> was found in a grave with beads and
resembles the typical pestles of Lytton except that it has no nipple on the top,
which is of the shape of the tops of the typical pestles of northern and western
Vancouver Island. Another of nearly the same shape but less regular was
found on the surface of the Yakima Valley within eight miles of North
Yakima. A third specimen 234 mm. long, also found within the above
mentioned limits, is made of a concavely flaring pebble. A groove is pecked
part way around near the top as if to carve the knob and begin the reduction
of the top of the shaft. There is also a pecked surface on one side near the
base, apparently the beginning of an attempt to form a striking head by first
removing irregularities. The one shown in <a href="#f28">Fig. 28</a> was found within eight
miles of North Yakima and is of rather unusual shape, having a short striking
head of the shape of the typical pestles of northern and western Vancouver
Island. The slightly bulging body and exceedingly small, nearly flat knob
at the top are entirely different from those of the pestles usually found in
any of this area, or the country adjacent to it on the north and west. These
four specimens are in the collection of Mr. Janeck.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><a href="#f29">Fig. 29</a> is the first of those showing the longer type of pestle from the
Yakima region. This specimen was found at Satus on the Yakima Reservation
near Old Yakima and is in the collection of Mr. York. The top is
somewhat spherical and the body elongated. Its conoid shape may class it
with the one shown in <a href="#f24">Fig. 24</a>. It somewhat reminds us of the pestles of the
Santa Catalina Islands of California, but until we have a more definite
knowledge of the forms in the vast intervening area, this resemblance must
be considered as merely a coincidence, especially since long simple conoid
pestles are found in the Nez Perce region to the east.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> A somewhat similar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45" name="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
pestle in Mr. York's collection is 408 mm. long, and has a tapering body,
circular in sections, a knob at the top about the size of the base and a convex
striking face. It was found at Fort Simcoe.</p>

<p>The pestle shown in <a href="#f30">Fig. 30</a> is made of sandstone, was found at Priest
Rapids and is in the collection of Mrs. Hinman. The shaft is a long cylinder,
expanding somewhat towards the base which is only slightly convex. Like
the preceding, it has no striking head. It has a hemispherical top, is unusually
large and is decorated with an encircling line of circles and dots.
There is also a circle and dot in the top. This decoration is again mentioned
in the consideration of art on <a href="#Page_130">p. 130</a>.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The pestle shown in <a href="#f31">Fig. 31</a> is 355 mm. long. It has a conoid body
perhaps more pronounced than the one shown in Fig. 29 but much less
typical than the one shown in <a href="#f24">Fig. 24</a>. The top is apparently intended to
represent an animal head. It is made of very hard breccia and well polished.
At each side of the lower part of the body is a design made by four parallel
zigzag grooves, further discussed on <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>. It was found in the Yakima
Valley, and is in the collection of Mr. Janeck.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> A pestle figured by Spinden,
as from the Nez Perce Indians,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> is somewhat similar to this in that it has a
knob protruding slightly to one side, but there is a notch or groove made
longitudinally in the top of this knob.</p>

<p>The pestle shown in <a href="#f32">Fig. 32</a> might perhaps be considered as a war club.
It was found at Priest Rapids and is in the collection of Mr. Mires. The
top is somewhat flat and smoothed. There is a groove around the specimen
near this end. From here it constricts gradually to the lower end which is
broken off. It was made from a triangular piece of gray basalt, probably
a column, the natural angles and parts of the faces of which have been reduced
by pecking.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The specimen shown in <a href="#f33">Fig. 33</a> from the Yakima Valley, is in the collection
of Mr. Janeck and is 630 mm. long. The top apparently represents
an animal head indicated by three nipples the larger of which is interpreted
as representing the nose, the others as indicating the ears. The body is of
circular cross section and expands evenly to a cylindrical striking head 70 mm.
in diameter by 76 mm. long.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>A long pestle with a knob at the top which is divided into four pyramidal
or dome-shaped nipples was found at Five Mile Rapids on Snake River and
was seen in Mr. Owen's collection. The next figure represents a stone pestle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of somewhat similar shape but more specialized. It was found in the
Yakima Valley and is in the collection of Mr. Janeck. It is 590 mm. long.
The top is roughly the form of the fustrum of a cone, being circular in cross
section and gradually expanding downward, but it is somewhat celt-shaped,
the sides for some distance being ground off nearly flat. They approach
each other more closely towards the front than they do towards the back.
In each of these surfaces there is an incision which represents one side of an
animal's mouth and a pecked dot indicating an eye. The tip of the nose is
broken off. Across the curved part behind the flat surfaces or on the back of
this animal head are four incisions. Below this portion the object is circular
in section until near its middle, or 178 mm. from the top, where there is a
band roughly sub-pentagonal in section with rounded corners 88 mm. long.
Following this band it is nearly cylindrical, being 57 mm. in diameter for
178 mm. until it expands suddenly into the striking head which is unusually
bulging, 108 mm. long by 64 mm. in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The object 498 mm. long shown in <a href="#f35">Fig. 35</a> is made of steatite, material
seemingly unsuited by its softness for a pestle, and may possibly be a war
club. Mr. McCandless, in whose collection it is, calls the material a soft
sandstone which he says is found at the head of the Wenatchie River. He
says the specimen is from Lake Chelan and that he obtained it from a man
above Wenatchie on the Columbia River. This man told him that he
secured it from Chief Moses' tribe on Lake Chelan, and that the Indians
there call it a war club and a family heirloom. The upper end is of the form
of a truncated pyramid with two flat sides, two bulging edge's and rounded
corners. It shows peck marks and is engraved as described under art,
on <a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>, and is said by the Indians to represent the head of a snake. The
shaft is circular in cross section and gradually enlarges towards the base
where it suddenly constricts. The specimen has been polished by the
natural sand blast.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The one shown in <a href="#f36">Fig. 36</a> from Priest Rapids is in the collection of Mrs.
Hinman. The convex ends of this cylindrical form present the natural
surface of a pebble and they are not battered. The material is a yellowish
quartzite or closely allied rock. It is 457 mm. long, 75 mm. in diameter
and the entire cylindrical surface has been pecked apparently to bring it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
form. If it had been used as a pestle the ends would show the signs of
battering or grinding. The cylindrical surface does not seem to show any
signs of its having been used as a roller or grinder. It may possibly be a
pestle in process of manufacture although it seems very strange that so much
work should have been expended on the cylindrical surface in a region where
natural pebbles very nearly of this shape were common.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The specimen
shown in <a href="#f37">Fig. 37</a> is apparently made of basalt and was found on the surface
about a mile east of Fort Simcoe. The ends are considerably chipped and
one of them has apparently been somewhat battered since. If the object
were used as a pestle the chipping of the ends is unusually great. The
cylindrical surface has been formed by pecking except in one place where the
natural surface shows. This bit of natural surface is such that it suggests
the specimen to have been made of a prismatic basaltic column. While
these two specimens may have been intended for pestles, it seems possible
that they were made for rollers. Several such objects made of stone were
seen in Mr. Owen's collection. He says that they were used like rolling pins
for crushing camas and kouse roots in making
bread. Both of these roots were extensively used
in the Nez Perce region to the east.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

the coast at Fraser Delta,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Comox,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and Nanaimo.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><a id="C20" name="C20"></a><i>Fire Making.</i> The method of making fire
formerly employed in this region is suggested by
a fragment of the hearth of a fire drill found in
grave No. 10 (5) in a rock-slide about one half a mile above the mouth of the
Naches River and is shown in <a href="#f38">Fig. 38</a>. It is made of porous wood, of light
cellular structure, possibly cottonwood. This is similar to the fire drill
hearths of the Thompson River region,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> where I have seen the Thompson
River Indians make fire with the palm drill, using cottonwood root for the
hearth. In the Nez Perce region to the east, also, fire was made with the
palm drill, the hearth stick being of the root of the light leaved willow or the
stem of "smoke wood." It was of the shape of the hearth here described.
The twirling stick was made of the dead tips of red fir.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><a id="C21" name="C21"></a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51" name="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><i>Caches.</i> A number of small circular holes about four feet in diameter,
encircled by a slight ridge, as mentioned on <a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>, were seen which are
possibly the remains of ancient food caches. The Nez Perce Indians in the
region to the east referred to a field at Kamiah, near the mouth of Lawyer's
Creek which has the appearance of being "hilled" like an old hop field, as
being the site of winter cache pits.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><a id="C22" name="C22"></a><i>Boiling.</i> Natural pebbles were plentiful in the river bottoms near the
village sites. Such were no doubt used in boiling food in baskets or boxes,
as fragments of burned and cracked pebbles were also found while pottery
was entirely absent. These facts suggest that it was the custom to boil the
food in baskets or even in boxes as on the coast to the west. This idea is
strengthened by the fact that in the Nez Perce region to the east, watertight
coiled baskets were regularly used in cooking.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> We may naturally suppose
that roasting before open fires was also customary in this region. No
fireplaces such as were probably used in this area and are found in the
Nez Perce region,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> were recognized by us, although beds of clam shells
previously mentioned, may indicate the sites of ancient hearths.</p>

<p><a id="C24" name="C24"></a><i>Semi-subterranean House Sites.</i> Sites of ancient semi-subterranean
winter houses, modern lodges and what may possibly have been a shell heap
were seen and photographed by us in this region. Two of the examples of
the remains of semi-subterranean house sites found here, as shown in <a href="#VI">Fig. 2,
Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span></a>, had stones on top of the surrounding embankments. Although
on the top of the embankments of the remains of similar underground winter
houses in the Thompson River region,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> we saw no stones other than those of
the soil. I am informed by Mr. James Teit that such are occasionally to
be found there also, but that these stones are generally found only in those
places where boulders were removed during the excavation for the houses.
He was told that it was the custom to place these boulders around the base
of the house. Two semi-subterranean winter house sites, as mentioned on
pp. <a href="#Page_7">7</a> and <a href="#Page_15">15</a>, may be seen on the flat along the north side of the Yakima
River about a mile below the mouth of the Naches. One of these may be
seen in <a href="#III">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span></a>.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> There are water-worn boulders in and on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>embankments surrounding them. These boulders were probably uncovered
during the excavation for the house. The holes are situated within twenty-five
feet of the river and between it and the Yakima Ridge which rises by
perpendicular cliffs, almost immediately behind these winter house sites.
In fact, the photograph reproduced in the figure was taken from the hill side
north of the pit and just up stream from the cliffs. They are on a little
terrace about three feet high which gives them the appearance of having
been connected by a ridge. The hole shown in the figure measured from the
top of the ridge was nine feet deep. The top of the bank measured at points
on the flat between it and the river, up stream from it, and between it and the
hill, was four feet, two feet, and two feet, four inches, respectively. Averaging
these measurements, the height of the embankment above the level is
thirty-three and one third inches. The hole was so near the level of the
river, and was so deep that when we visited it on June 18, 1903, which was
during high water, the waters of the Yakima had soaked through the terrace
and were about two feet deep in the bottom of the hole where it was about
eight feet in diameter, measuring north and south. Measuring in the same
direction the diameter of the top of the hole from points inside of the surrounding
ridge was twenty-two feet, from points on top thirty-three feet,
from points outside forty-seven feet, and from points outside of the wash
from the ridge fifty-one feet. These measurements give us twelve and a half
feet as an approximate width of the ridge or fourteen and a half feet if we
measure from the bottom of the wash. The two sites mentioned on pp. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>
and <a href="#Page_16">16</a> were also examined and photographed by us. One is plainly shown
from the north of west in <a href="#IV">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span></a>. They are located on a high
terrace on the north side of the Naches River about one and a half miles
above its mouth. There are angular rocks on each encircling ridge. Some
of the large angular rocks found on the embankment of this ridge, may also
have been dug out during the excavation for the house if such rocks are
found under the surface of the soil in this terrace. Similar rocks are scattered
about on the surface so thickly that it must have been necessary to remove a
number of them from the site where the house was to stand and possibly
others that were scattered about may have been put up around the base
of the house in order to clear the immediate vicinity especially since many of
them are disagreeably sharp angular fragments.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Measuring the site best shown in the figure, east and west, the level floor
inside the extreme wash from the ridge is nine feet in diameter, the rocks
fallen from the ridge thirteen feet, the inner edge of the ridge 20 feet, the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>points on the top of the embankment, twenty-five and a half feet; the outside
of the rocks, thirty feet; the extremes of the embankment thirty-five feet.
These measurements north and south are respectively, nine feet, thirteen and
a half feet, sixteen and a half feet, twenty-one feet, twenty-five and a half
feet and thirty-three feet. Judging from these measurements, the original
dimensions were probably thirty feet by twenty-five and a half feet over all,
twenty-five and a half feet by twenty-one feet for the top of the embankment,
twenty by sixteen and a half feet for the inside of the embankment and
sixteen and a half feet by fifteen feet for the bottom of the floor. These
measurements are also east and west and north and south respectively. The
present depth of the hole below the top of the rocks is twenty-nine inches and
from the top of the earth embankment is twenty-six and twenty-one inches.
The measurements were taken east and west and north and south respectively.
The slope of the hill from north to south and its attendant wash, of course,
affect the north and south measurements, while the east and west measurements
are probably near the original dimensions. Contiguous to this hole
on the south, or in the sage brush to the right in the figure, is the other site.
It is on the slope of the hill and not so clearly shown in the Plate. This hole
measures ten and a half feet by eleven feet across the level floor inside;
thirteen by fourteen feet inside of the rocks; nineteen by eighteen feet at the
top of the embankment twenty-three by twenty-three feet outside of the
rocks; and twenty-seven by twenty-six feet outside of the embankment;
fourteen and eighteen inches in depth from the top of the rocks and ten and
twelve inches from the top of the earth, the measurements being taken east
and west and north and south respectively.</p>

<p>Mr. G. R. Shafer informed me that there were holes, the remains of old
houses on the flat in the Naches Valley, twelve miles above the Nelson
Bridge which crosses the river a short distance above the mouth of Cowiche
Creek. At Fort Simcoe, immediately south of the Indian agency, on the
north edge of "scab land" overlooking a small ravine as mentioned on
<a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>, is a large pit surrounded by an embankment of earth, the remains
of a winter house site. This hole is so deep and the embankment is so high
that both Mrs. Lynch and the Indians call it a fort. About fifteen miles
above Kennewick on the eastern side of the Columbia River, according to
Mr. D. W. Owen, there were the remains of hundreds of semi-underground
winter houses and we saw several large and deep sites immediately below
Mr. Craig's house above Priest Rapids as mentioned on page 20.</p>

<p>A semi-subterranean winter house, with an entrance through the roof,
seen by Lewis and Clark<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> on the north side of the Columbia near the mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>of White Salmon River, was uninhabited at that time (1805). As described,
it does not differ from the winter house of the Thompson Indians. The
Chinook, so far as we know, never erected such houses. The pit of an
underground house, according to Clark<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> was found among the Nez Perce.
Gibbs<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> mentions what were probably similar pits on the Lower Yakima.
Kane<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> describes a somewhat similar house used by the Walla Walla but
much ruder. Such houses were used by the Klamath.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Not far from the ranch of Mr. Frank Turner on Rock Creek about six
miles below Rock Lake on Section 6, Town 18 north, Range 40 east in the
country locally known as "The Rocks," there are two pits that are supposed
to be the remains of houses which with other remains (pp. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>, <a href="#Page_82">82</a>, <a href="#Page_140">140</a>) have
been in their present condition since about 1874 when they were first seen by
the whites. Both the pioneers and the old Indians are said to know nothing
about them. Mr. Turner's place is best reached from Sprague on the
Northern Pacific Railroad, although his Post Office is Winona. My information
regarding these two pits is from Mr. J. S. Cotton, then in charge of
cooperative range work in Washington.</p>

<p>It is quite possible as pointed out by Lewis<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> that the introduction of the
buffalo skin covered lodge which probably came after the advent of the horse
into this region, had something to do with the apparent scarcity of the semi-subterranean
winter house in the Yakima region in historic times, the buffalo
skin lodge possibly having taken the place of the earth-covered dwellings.</p>

<p>The so-called cremation circles near Cherry Creek and near the mouth
of the Naches which were mentioned on pp. <a href="#Page_12">12</a> and <a href="#Page_15">15</a> and described on
pp. <a href="#Page_163">163</a> and <a href="#Page_157">157</a>, may be the remains of small houses of the type of semi-subterranean
winter house sites that were made especially as grave houses.
As before mentioned, this type of semi-subterranean circular lodge is found
as far north as the Thompson River country, and I have seen one site on the
prairie near Rochester, Thurston Co., probably of this type. In the Nez
Perce region to the east, remains that appear like those of semi-subterranean
houses consisting of ridges of earth about a foot above the general level of the
ground, surrounding a circular pit, from three to five feet deep, measuring
from the top of the ridge; and about seventy feet in diameter, are found near
the mouth of Tammany Creek on the east bank of Snake River, a few miles
above Lewiston. The site may be identified with Hasutin.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The place
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>is known to have been used as a camp until about 1878, especially during
the season of lamprey eel fishing. These house rings are in several groups.
A little charcoal, some unio shell, flint chips, a digging stick with a bone
handle, glass beads and other objects are reported to have been found in
them. Somewhat similar house rings about twenty-five feet in diameter
were found on the south bank of the Middle fork of Clearwater River, near
the town of Kooskia. Spinden<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> refers to Lewis and Clark<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> for evidence
of considerable antiquity for the circular house rings in this Nez Perce
region. They mention one as being about thirty feet in diameter with a
rim over three feet high and the floor sunken four feet below the surface of
the ground or seven feet below the top of the rim. The Mountain Snakes,
according to Ross<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> never used underground houses.</p>

<p>At the site near Kooskia there is another type of house site such as I have
not seen in the Yakima, Thompson or Coast regions. Spinden describes
them as long and narrow, about sixty to eighty-five feet long by eighteen feet
wide. The interior is sunken from one to three feet and surrounded by well
marked elevated rims. As a rule, these pits are not so deep or clearly marked
as those of the circular type. The axis of the house is parallel with the
river. He states that these house sites have not been used for a long time
and that trees, some of which are eighteen inches in diameter grow directly
out of them. Excavation revealed a number of fireplaces about twelve feet
apart along the axis of these houses suggesting that they were communal
lodges.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> We discovered no indications of communal dwellings in the
Yakima region.</p>

<p><a id="C25" name="C25"></a><i>Circles of Stones (Summer House Sites).</i> A circle of stones which marked
a small lodge site was examined and photographed. The stones were no
doubt cleared from the interior and all or part of these possibly with others,
were no doubt used to hold down the lodge covers. Although I saw no such
circle of stones in the Thompson River region I am informed by Mr. Teit
that they are occasionally to be seen there and that they represent old lodge
sites. The circle of stones above-mentioned as described on <a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a> was
found on a terrace somewhat lower than the one on which were situated the
remains of the two semi-subterranean houses described on <a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a> This
terrace is a few yards down stream from the one on which they stand, and is
separated from it by a small ravine. The site is a little further down the
stream and towards the southeast. It is shown in <a href="#IV">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span></a>,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the point on the hillside a few feet above it to the north, shown on the lower
end of the slope in <a href="#IV">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IV</span></a> and in negative nos. 44491, 5-4, and
44492, 5-5. This circle of stones on the level ground was made up of angular
rocks such as are scattered on the immediate surface. It measures ten
by eleven feet in diameter inside; fifteen by seventeen feet from the top of
the circle; and twenty-two by twenty-three feet over all. The top of the
highest stones was from fourteen to twelve inches above the middle of the
space enclosed which as before stated, seemed to be on a level with the outside,
all measuring being east to west and north to south respectively.
Among the rocks was found a chipped piece of jasper or brown chalcedony.</p>

<p>No saucer-shaped depressions were seen in the Yakima region, although
it is quite probable that they formerly existed and have been obliterated by
weathering. It will be remembered that such saucer-shaped depressions are
often made by sweeping out the summer lodges in the Thompson River
region<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and that they marked the sites of such houses.</p>

<p>Two summer lodges photographed<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> by us near Ellensburg which were
mentioned on page 12 and the one seen below Union Gap down stream from
Old Yakima, resemble those of the Thompson River region to the
north. It will be remembered that mat covered tipis are found in the Nez
Perce region to the east.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Lewis and Clark<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> mention but one buffalo skin
lodge among the Nez Perce in 1806 and that was apparently reserved for
special occasions, but a few years later this type of lodge had practically
supplanted the mat lodge among that tribe and was in common use among
all the interior Salish and Sahaptin tribes. The mat houses of the Yakima
are mentioned by Gibbs in the Pacific Railroad Reports.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>A pile of stones shown in <a href="#V">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span></a><a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and mentioned on <a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a> as
uncovered by the wash of the flood waters of the Columbia, was seen on the
bottom-lands on the western side of the Columbia, south of Sentinal Bluffs
and within a hundred feet north of the house of Mr. Britain Everette Craig.
It is possible that this may have been a house hearth or ancient cooking place,
although the presence of human bones among these stones, suggests that it
was a grave covered with flat oval river pebbles. Near by, uncovered by the
same wash, was a small patch of fresh water unio shells shown from the west
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57" name="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>of south in <a href="#V">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span></a>.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> This was probably kitchen refuse. The little
pits, each encircled with a slight embankment made up of the soil thrown
out in making it, <a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>, are probably the remains of food caches near the
houses.</p>

<h2><a id="C26" name="C26"></a><span class="smcap">Tools Used by Men.</span></h2>

<p>A number of objects which seem to be tools intended to be used by men
are found in this region. Among these may be mentioned a wedge, hammerstones,
a celt, a hand-adze, drills, scrapers, and an arrow-shaft smoother.</p>

<p><a id="C27" name="C27"></a><i>Wedges.</i> Wedges made of antler were not frequently found by us as in
the Thompson River region,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> although according to Lewis, elk horn wedges
or chisels were used for splitting wood in the general
plateau region of which this is a part.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> One specimen,
however (202-8378b), was found on the surface near
the head of Priest Rapids, which is apparently a
longitudinal fragment of a wedge broken off at the top
and cut by longitudinal grooving along one edge, the
other edge being a portion of the surface of the wedge
formed by cutting convexly across the antler. The
specimen is bleached from exposure on the surface.
Another wedge, shown in <a href="#f39">Fig. 39</a>, was found on the
surface near the Columbia River below the mouth of
the Snake. It is made of antler which has since been
bleached from exposure on the surface of the ground.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 39 (20.0-1464).
Wedge made of Antler. From the surface near the Columbia River below the
Mouth of the Snake. &frac12; nat. size. (Collected
and presented by Mr. Owen.)</span>
</div>

<p>The top was partly cut off and then broken across,
while one side edge shows where the antler was grooved
lengthwise for over half its length, from the inner surface
and then broken out. This shows that the process
of cutting up pieces of antler in this region was similar
to that employed in cutting both antler and nephrite, in
the Thompson River region and on the coast of British
Columbia and Washington. It has since been battered.
One side shows the nearly flat outer surface of part
of the antler, the other has been cut off to form the
wedge, which is constricted towards the point so that it
assumes a somewhat spatulate form. This specimen is twisted, until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>point is in a plane about 45° from the poll. It was collected by Mr. Owen
who believes it to have been used as a spatula for grinding paint upon
the surface of a rock. Wedges made of elk antler are common in the Nez
Perce region where they are said to have almost completely supplanted
celts.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Although no wedges were found by us in the Yakima Valley proper, and
we can mention only these two specimens in the whole Yakima region yet
it seems probable that they were here used and for the same purposes as in
the Thompson River region to the north, the Nez Perce area to the east and
on the coast to the west for splitting timber, for cutting firewood and for
general carpenter work. Perhaps their relative scarcity here, as compared
with the Thompson and the Nez Perce country, may be explained by supposing
that wooden wedges, such as are more common than antler wedges
on the coast, and which may have decayed were here used more than those
made of antler.</p>

<p>While the stone hammers or pestles with convex bases, which are described
on <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a> et seq. were probably largely used for crushing food and
other material; yet some of them and those with concave bases, were undoubtedly
sometimes used as hammers for driving wedges, setting stakes,
pinning out skins and for similar purposes.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 40 (202-8128). Hammerstone. From quarry on north side of Naches River
about two miles above its mouth. &frac12; nat. size.</span>
</div>

<p><a id="C28" name="C28"></a><i>Hammerstones.</i> The deeply pitted hammer, such as is found in the
Mississippi Valley, was not seen here, and it will be remembered<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> that they
were not found in the Thompson River region. Tough pebbles, however,
were used for pounding. At the quarry shop mentioned on <a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>, we found
a number of pebbles that were evidently used in breaking up the material out
of which to make chipped implements. One of these (202-8129) is merely
a water-worn pebble, 73 mm. long, an edge of which has been broken off,
and a sharp corner shows signs of its having been used as a hammer, as it has
been battered and shows where one large chip has come off. It will be
remembered that in the vicinity of the shop where the specimen was found,
pebbles were rarely if ever seen, although the surface of the ground was
covered with weathered fragments of volcanic rock. Another specimen
(202-8127) found at the same place, shown southeast of the quarry pit, in
<a href="#III">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span></a>, is 155 mm. long and of a rather irregular cross section.
The ends are battered and fractured from use. Apparently it may have been
held between the two hands and used in breaking off large pieces of material.
A longer hammer pebble, bearing the same catalogue number, and found at
the same place, shows on the top of the quarry dump to the left centre in
<a href="#III">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span></a>. It is about 270 mm. long. In cross section it tends to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>triangular with rounded corners. The ends are battered and long slivers
have been broken off. The specimen shown in <a href="#f40">Fig. 40</a> is from the same
place, shorter, but similar in that the section is sub-triangular and that each
end is both battered and slivered. Other battered pebbles and fragments
slivered from them were found at the same place. The hammerstone shown
in <a href="#f41">Fig. 41</a> was found on the surface near the head of Priest Rapids. It
is an oval pebble, nearly twice as wide as it is thick, of yellowish brown color,
which has been used for a hammer, as is indicated by the battered and chipped
condition of its ends.</p>

<p>Another specimen, shown in <a href="#f42">Fig. 42</a>, is made of a hard, dark green or
bluish, water-worn pebble. It was found in the Snake River Valley,
twenty miles above the mouth of the river, and is in the collection of Mr.
Owen. Both ends are battered and the margins of the battered surfaces
are chipped. Mr. Owen says such objects were used in pecking pestles,
mortars, and similar implements into shape. <a href="#f43">Fig. 43</a> illustrates one of these
hammerstones, found on the surface at Kennewick. It is a part of a pebble
of tough dark blue material, apparently glassy basalt. One side edge and
one end have been chipped and show large scars on each side of the side
edge and several on one side of the top. Near the middle of one side, and
opposite it on the other side edge, there are signs of pecking which suggest
an attempt at grooving. The lower corner of the pebble shows signs of
having been used as a hammer for pecking. A small spatulate pebble
slightly curved (202-8215), found at the same place, is battered entirely
around the edge of its larger end and in one place on the side of the narrow
end. The battering has given it a smooth surface in places which suggests
that it was used for pecking, rather than chipping. A large, rather flat, oval
pebble (202-8213) from the same place has large chips off from both sides
of its edge in three places, three fourths of its edge being so chipped. This
seems more likely to be a hammerstone used for chipping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>The long, narrow, oval pebble, shown in <a href="#f44">Fig. 44</a>, is about 140 mm. long,
of a yellow, volcanic, coarse-grained rock, and is in the collection of Mr.
Austin Mires of Ellensburg. This was found at Priest Rapids. The top
is battered and slightly chipped, the other end has been battered to a rather
flat edge, and this battered surface extends one half way up one side of the
specimen and two thirds of the way up the other.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> A large flat oval pebble
(202-8214), found on the Cherry Creek camp site, has a notch pecked in
each side edge and is battered slightly on one end. It may have been notched
for hafting as a hammer, or for use as a net sinker, but the battered end
suggests the former use. These pebbles which have been used as hammerstones,
remind us of the unbattered pebbles found with pieces of glassy
basalt in certain caches near Kamloops.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Pebbles used as hammerstones
are also found in the Nez Perce region to the east<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and according to Lewis
stone hammers were used for splitting wood in the general plateau region
of which this is a part.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>A pebble, oval in outline and in cross section (202-8303), found on the
surface of the bank of the Columbia River, near the head of Priest Rapids,
is battered on one side edge near the middle in a way that suggests that the
place was for the reception of the end of a handle. The lower edge is battered
and the top has a large chip off of each side. It was probably used as
a hammerstone. Another flat oval pebble of lava (202-8305) found at the
same place, is chipped on both sides of the entire edge; but the edge is not
sharp, apparently having been dulled by scraping, the natural sand blast or
weathering. A disk or sub-oblong-shaped pebble (202-8304) also found at
the same place is chipped from one side only across the entire edge at a slight
bevel so that it has a nearly flat edge. The high places of the edge are
smoothed as if from its use in pecking, yet it does not seem to have been much
used for such a purpose or to need to have been chipped into disk form for
that use.</p>

<p>None of the pebbles which were notched and supposed to be net sinkers,
as mentioned on <a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a> and that were found in this region, show battered

<p><a id="C29" name="C29"></a><i>Celts.</i> Celts made of stone such as were common in the Thompson River
region<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> were not found by us in the Yakima region; but one typical specimen
which apparently resembles the celts found on Puget Sound, more than it
does those found in the Thompson River region is shown in <a href="#f45">Fig. 45</a>. It may
be seen in the collection of Mr. McCandless who secured it from an Indian
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>at Ellensburg. This celt is made of serpentine and is 190 mm. long.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> A
similar specimen, in the same collection, resembles this one but shows
grooves along the side edges by means of which it was cut out. There is a
celt made of green serpentine, only about 3 mm. thick in the collection of
Mr. Owen, but it was found at Umatilla, Oregon.</p>

<p>Celts of jadeite (?) narrow and oblong were found on Snake River above
Lewiston in the Nez Perce region to the east.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Spinden states that these were
evidently acquired by trade from natives of the northwest coast and that
they have been cut by grooving and breaking. Also, that this method and
material was not employed by the Nez Perce who considered the objects to
have been used as wedges. I am inclined to believe, therefore, that these
more nearly resemble the celts of the Thompson River country<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> than they
do those of the coast. At least one celt of this general style has been found
near Lake Chelan lying between the Thompson River region and both the
Yakima and Nez Perce regions. It is a long stone celt and was found in an
ancient grave on the bank of the Chelan River near the house of Hon. Amos
Edmunds, of Chelan, Washington. In the graves of this group, according
to Mr. C. G. Ridout, who cooperated with Mr. Edmunds in excavating at
this place, and from whom all of our information on this specimen was
obtained, stone knives and skinning and scraping tools were found. This
celt is of a mottled green "marble resembling onyx" (probably serpentine
or nephrite) 400 mm. long, 47 mm. wide and 15 mm. thick. It is slightly
concave on the two sides, while one side edge is flat and the other is concavely
bevelled. The poll is of the natural unworked stone and judging
from the drawing furnished by Mr. Ridout, was broken off. It is raggedly
diagonal. The cutting edge is sharpened by long convexly ground surfaces
of nearly equal size and curve. The bevel of the side edge suggests that the
material for the celt was cut out by grooving and breaking as was the case
in the Thompson River region, where the celts showed similar traces of
grooving.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> It is true that similar grooving may be seen on celts from the
Coast, but in that region the celts are short, while in the Thompson River
area they are long like this one and the material is more often of the mottled
green color than on the coast. The specimen is owned by Mr. Edmunds
and is in the collection of Mr. Ridout.</p>

<p>No pieces of antler or other material which may possibly have served as
celt hafts were found in this region, although it will be remembered that one
specimen, thought possibly to have been such, was found at Kamloops in the

surface near the head of Priest Rapids, is much bleached and shows signs
of having been daubed with red paint. It consists of a piece which has
been cut around below a fork with some sharp instrument and then broken
off. The prongs seem to be simply broken off.</p>

<p><a id="C30" name="C30"></a><i>Hand-Adze.</i> Only one hand-adze has been
found in this area, so far as I am aware. It is catalogue No. 25 in the collection of Mr. Janeck, made
of stone and found near the surface of an old burial ground of the Indians near the mouth of the
Yakima River on what is known as McNeals Island. This specimen is shown in <a href="#f46">Fig. 46</a>, and
is 165 mm. long, 228 mm. in greatest circumference which is around the part corresponding to
the edge of the striking head of a pestle, 37 mm. in diameter at the top and 37 mm. along the edge
of the blade. It is made of rock resembling diorite or diabase. The natural surface of the
pebble from which it was made shows on the ridge of the striking head of the pestle-like part.
The convex side of the celt-like part of the object is very smooth. This is apparently partly due to
the fact that it presents the smooth natural surface of the pebble from which the object was
made, and also to more or less friction which must have been received here when in use. It
probably served as an adze. This specimen is perhaps the most ideal form of this type that I
have seen, the upper end comparing closely to a pestle, with a slight indication of a knob at the
top, a flaring body, and a short striking head, the sides of which extend as a ridge nearly if not
entirely around the specimen. The celt-like part is to one side of the axis, so that one side expands to meet the ridge above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>mentioned, forming a concavity; the other contracts to meet it forming
a convex sweep from the cutting edge to the beginning of the body of the
pestle-like part.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Such hand-adzes have been found at Portland, Columbia
Slough about ten miles below Portland,[2] and Mr. E. D. Zimmerman of
Philadelphia has informed me that there are five or six specimens of this
type in his collection but the discovery of this specimen at McNeals Island
marks the most eastern occurrence of this type, so far as I know at present.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p><a id="C31" name="C31"></a><i>Whetstones.</i> Whetstones, recognized as such, are rare in the Yakima
region but a fragment (202-8217) of a sandstone pebble, which is apparently
rubbed on the irregular sides was found on the surface of the little camp site,
west of Cherry Creek, near Ellensburg. It probably served as a rough whetstone
or for grinding implements into shape.</p>

<p>The cigar-shaped object made of friable stone, shown in <a href="#f69">Fig. 69</a>, and
considered on <a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a> as a war implement or "slave-killer," is suitable for use
as a whetstone and may have been such. The object thought to be a whetstone
shown in <a href="#f120">Fig. 120</a>, is in the collection of Mr. Janeck, and is said to be
from the Yakima Valley. It is made of friable slate; the top is broken off.
It is 142 mm. long, 18 mm. wide and 6 mm. thick with rounded edges. The
circle and dot design incised on the specimen is described on <a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a>. It
would seem that use as a whetstone would destroy the design.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> From the

the coast.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The specimen shown in <a href="#f47">Fig. 47</a>, was collected at the head of
Priest Rapids, and presented by Mrs. J. B. Davidson of Ellensburg. It is
chipped from a grayish chalcedony. The shaft is rather blunt at the end,
possibly having been broken off, and is somewhat lozenge-shaped in cross
section although one side has a less pronounced ridge than the other which
causes the section to tend towards the sub-triangular. The base expands
sidewise and is somewhat thinner at the end than at the shaft although it is
thicker than the point. A point somewhat similar in shape, but 57 mm. long,
chipped from white chalcedony, and found at Priest Rapids, was seen in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>collection of Mr. Austin Mires. Another drill point chipped from black
trap, 48 mm. long, and also found at Priest Rapids, was seen in the same
collection. The shaft expands sidewise into a base of the form of a truncated
triangle which is rather thin. <a href="#f48">Fig. 48</a> shows a drill point chipped from
reddish brown chert that was found on the surface near the head of Priest
Rapids. The upper portion resembles the first-mentioned specimen and
the lower part is somewhat similar to it but more lenticular in cross section.
In other words, the implement is either double-pointed or it was intended
to chip away the lower part. The lower point is so well chipped to form
that it seems more likely to be a double-pointed drill.</p>

<p>Holes which have been drilled and apparently with such drills as these
are seen in the stone objects shown in Figs. <a href="#f34">34</a>, <a href="#f77">77</a>, <a href="#f81">81</a>, <a href="#f99">99</a>, <a href="#f105">105</a>, <a href="#f119">119</a>. The
shell object shown in <a href="#f88">Fig. 88</a> probably was broken; but in Figs. <a href="#f76">76</a>, <a href="#f79">79</a>, <a href="#f90">90</a>,
<a href="#f91">91</a>, <a href="#f93">93</a> and <a href="#f94">94</a>, the shell seems drilled and in Fig. <a href="#f73">73</a> the antler is drilled.</p>

<p><a id="C33" name="C33"></a><i>Scrapers.</i> For scraping and shaving, the objects shown in Figs. <a href="#f49">49</a>-<a href="#f52">52</a>
would have been useful. One side of these consists of a large facet, as in
the case of <a href="#f50">Fig. 50</a>, or is but slightly chipped. This surface on the first two
specimens shows the bulb of percussion, while on the fourth all signs of the
bulb have apparently been obliterated by secondary chipping along a longitudinal
third, probably done to flatten the side, although as this scraper
was made from a fragment of a flake rather than from the whole flake it is
possible that the bulb was not on this piece. In the third specimen the bulb
does not show as the object was not made from a flake but from a thin piece
of chalcedony which shows striations upon both surfaces suggesting that it
may have been the filling or cast of a seam from which it has separated.
The upper ends of the first two specimens are somewhat convex on this
surface probably because of the bulb of percussion. The lower or wider
ends, which are chipped to a scraping edge from the opposite side on all the
specimens are somewhat concave or at least flat as in the third specimen.
The other two are not so regular in outline, but are also chipped like a scraper
at the broad end and the side edges. The specimen shown in <a href="#f52">Fig. 52</a> was
found on the surface of the little camp site on Cherry Creek, near Ellensburg,
and is of a waxy, yellowish brown chalcedony. It is shaped something like
a gun flint.</p>

<p>There is a scraper 66 mm. long made of a greenish slate in the collection
of Mrs. Davidson to whom it was presented by Mr. Owen. It is somewhat
tongue-shaped and slightly concave-convex. The base is broken while the
curved edge is slightly chipped on the convex side to form an edge. The
point is rather thin and has been somewhat rubbed. Red paint has been
daubed on the specimen which suggests that it may have been found in a
grave. It will be remembered that scrapers were found, although not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
frequently, in the Thompson River region<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> to the north and that in the Nez
Perce region to the east,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> they are usually irregular in form, flat on one side
and convex on the other. While their chief use may have been for skin
scraping, they are found by experiment to be excellent implements for planing
wood, and may well have served for the scraping down of arrow-shafts, spear-shafts,
and for similar work.</p>

<p>Some of the chipped points described on <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a> may have been used for
knife points. Among these there are a number of specimens which were
particularly suited for this use. The specimen shown in <a href="#f6">Fig. 6</a> may have
served as a knife, possibly one used for ceremonial purposes although it may
have been used as a spear point. These knives, being somewhat symmetrical
differ from the one found at Kamloops<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> in the Thompson River region
which was similar in shape to the knives used until recently by the Thompson
River Indians.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> These knives from the Thompson River region are chipped
much more from one side than from the other and have curved points. The
specimen shown in <a href="#f3">Fig. 3</a> (202-8336) has an absolutely flat base which is
apparently an unworked portion of the block from which the object was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>chipped. It is possibly an unfinished arrow point, but its outline suggests
that it is a knife point. The specimen shown in <a href="#f2">Fig. 2</a> is chipped from waxy
red chalcedony. It has a straight end and one edge of the point is slightly
more curved than the other, which together with the fact that one side is
nearly flat suggests that it may have been one of those points which are
considered to have been used for knives rather than for arrow or spear points.
The specimen (202-8369) shown in <a href="#f1">Fig. 1</a> may have served either as the tip
for an arrow or as a knife point, and it may be compared with the much
more deeply serrated points found in the Thompson River region.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

collection of Mr. E. R. McDonald at Ellensburg. It was collected by Mr.
Dick Williams, of the same place, who found it on the west bank of the
Columbia River, twenty miles north of Priest Rapids, Kittitas County. It
is made of a salmon-colored gritstone, and is of the usual type, semi-cylindrical
with a longitudinal groove on the flat side, in this case a very small
groove such as might occur if it had not been much used. In the Nez Perce
region to the east,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> according to Spinden, there have been found an arrow-shaft
smoother made up of two somewhat rectangular blocks of light tufa,
each with a semi-cylindrical groove in one side and a soapstone object which
he considers to be an arrow-shaft polisher, but I have considered this as a mat
presser.</p>

<h2><a id="C35" name="C35"></a><span class="smcap">Tools Used by Women.</span></h2>

<p>A number of implements were found which may have served for the
preparation of skins and for sewing. Among these may be mentioned skin
scrapers, awls, a needle, and a mat presser.</p>

<p><a id="C36" name="C36"></a><i>Scrapers Chipped from Stone.</i> The scrapers chipped from stone, shown
in Figs. <a href="#f49">49</a> to <a href="#f52">52</a>, and considered among tools used by men on <a href="#Page_67">pp. 67-68</a>,
may possibly have been used on skins although they seem rather small for
such a purpose. The specimen shown in <a href="#f53">Fig. 53</a>, made from a flat circular
pebble was found on the surface of the bank of the Columbia River, near
the head of Priest Rapids. The edges are chipped in such a way that it has
been brought somewhat to the form of a square. This object would serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
well as a skin scraper if hafted in the split end of a stick and used like similar
implements seen in use by us among the natives of the Thompson River
region.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> It resembles archaeological specimens from the same area.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In
the Nez Perce region to the east<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> a disk-shaped spall struck from a boulder
was used for skin scraping. Another form, shown in <a href="#f54">Fig. 54</a>, is chipped
from a pebble, probably a flat circular one. Along one side, the surface of
the pebble shows, but on the other it has been completely chipped away.
In outline, the object is elliptical, but has a slight tendency to be pointed at
each end. It is lenticular in section, with the edges jaggedly sharp. This
reminds us of certain specimens found at Columbus and The Dalles, which
have the same general shape, but are ground and polished, so that no signs
of chipping remain on some of them. It seems probable that this specimen
is a roughed-out form of the same kind, which may have been used in its present
condition, or was intended to be finished by grinding and polishing. It
seems quite likely that this implement may have been hafted in the end of a
split stick and used as a skin scraper, similar to those previously mentioned.
On the other hand, it may have been held in the hand and used in scraping
skins or perhaps as a knife. It was found with another on the surface of the
bank of the Columbia River, near the head of Priest Rapids. Another of
these (202-8117) was found on the surface at Kennewick. The specimen
shown in <a href="#f55">Fig. 55</a> is simply an oval water-worn pebble with one edge chipped
on both sides. It is 115 mm. long by 16 mm. thick, may be an unfinished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>object, if not a scraper or knife, and was found on the surface of the bank
of the Columbia River near the head of Priest Rapids.</p>

<p><a id="C37" name="C37"></a><i>Scrapers Rubbed from Bone.</i> Scrapers made of bone, similar to those
found by us in the Thompson River region and in the vicinity of Puget
Sound<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> were not seen in the Yakima region.</p>

<p><a id="C38" name="C38"></a><i>Awls Rubbed from Bone.</i> Awls made of bone have been found in this
area. The specimens made of stone, mentioned on <a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a> among chipped
points, and on <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a> among drills may have been used by women for the
same purposes. The specimen shown in <a href="#f56">Fig. 56</a>, was found on the surface
of an island in the Columbia River near the mouth of the Snake, and it is
bleached from exposure. It was collected and presented by Mr. D. W.
Owen. The specimen shown in <a href="#f57">Fig. 57</a>, was found on an island in the
Columbia River, forty miles above the mouth of the Snake, and it is bleached
from exposure on the surface. The shaft is nearly circular in cross section
and tapers to a point for one half its length. The base ends in a flat elbow
piece. The outline of the end of this projection is rounded. The specimen
was collected and presented by Mr. D. W. Owen.</p>

<p>No awls made from the proximal part of the ulna of the deer were seen
by us in this area, although it will be remembered they were found in the
Thompson River region<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and are reported from the Nez Perce region to the

<p>This seems rather interesting since these two kinds of
awls, each made of a special bone are so commonly
found and so widely distributed in America that it
seems hardly possible that they may not yet be found
in this region. Simple sharpened bone implements
which are said to have been used as awls are found in
the Nez Perce region<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> where according to Spinden, a
small awl was used in making basketry but we saw
none in the Yakima region not considered to be points
for arrows or spears.</p>

<p><a id="C39" name="C39"></a><i>Needles.</i> Only one object which may be considered
as a needle was seen by us in the Yakima region, and
it will be remembered that they are rare on the coast of
British Columbia and Washington, except in the Lower

13, in the collection of Mr. Janeck. The object is warped or bent like the
needles used in the Puget Sound country to string cat-tail stalks together in
order to make mats. This specimen is 291 mm. long. The point is sharpened
and although the side edges are flat, it somewhat resembles a paper
knife. At a point nearly one third of its length from the base, it is perforated
through the middle by gouging from each side. The base is notched, in
such a way that the object is bilaterally symmetrical as shown in the illustration.
It may possibly but not probably have served as a sap scraper.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p><a id="C40" name="C40"></a><i>Mat Pressers.</i> Mat pressers, or objects that are considered to be such,
made of stone are commonly found in the area immediately to the south.
No objects recognized as such were found by us in the Thompson River
region, and from the coast of British Columbia and Washington there is
only one. It is made of stone<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and was found at Cadboro Bay near Victoria.
Specimens made of wood are very common among the present natives of
the same coast. A ground soapstone object from the Nez Perce region is
considered by Spinden an arrow-shaft polisher,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> but seems to me more
likely to be a mat presser of the type found in the region immediately south
of the Yakima area.</p>

<p>The object shown in <a href="#f59">Fig. 59</a> which may be an unfinished pipe, is of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>form of a flattened cylinder, made of steatite and was found at Prosser in
the southern part of the area here considered. The surface is marked with
incised figures, part of which are illustrated in <a href="#f59">Fig. 59b</a> and described on
<a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>. The groove on one side suggests that it may have been used as a
mat presser such as are used to string cat-tails and tule stalks. The cylindrical
bore in the top is 25 mm. deep by 10 mm. in diameter and its top is
funnel-shaped. The original is in the collection of Mr. Spalding.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<h2><a id="C41" name="C41"></a><span class="smcap">Processes of Manufacture.</span></h2>

<p>The processes of manufacture employed in this area as indicated by the
archaeological objects found include fracturing by chipping and flaking,
pecking or bruising, grinding, polishing, cutting by grooving and breaking,
incising, whittling and gouging, and drilling. The materials worked by
each of these processes may be seen among the specimens here figured and
described. Spinden states<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> that in the Nez Perce area chipped implements
were made by the men and that the pecked artifacts were made by the
women.</p>

<h2><a id="C42" name="C42"></a><span class="smcap">Life Histories of Manufactured Objects.</span></h2>

<p>The story of the manufacture of the objects found from the securing of
the raw material to their finished and to their worn out and broken condition
is not shown completely in the case of more than one class of objects, viz.,
chipped implements, but in a number of cases the signs of manufacture have
not been entirely obliterated and some specimens are figured and described
which are undoubtedly in process of manufacture. <a href="#III">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>, Fig. 1</a> shows
a quarry from which material for the manufacture of chipped implements was
obtained. A description of this has been given on <a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>. Here could be
seen the hammers, one of which is illustrated in <a href="#f40">Fig. 40</a>, that were used in
breaking up the raw material, and the material in various stages of chipping
and flaking together with the waste products. In <a href="#I">Plates <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span></a> and <a href="#II"><span class="smcap lowercase">II</span></a> may
be seen the more or less completed chipped implements. If points of antler
were used as flakers, they were either not found or recognized by us. According
to Mr. Cotton, there are numerous chips within the "fort" mentioned
on <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>. One other example of a series illustrating the life history of
an object may be mentioned, namely, that of the pestles. Many oblong peb<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>bles
suitable for pestles without being changed from their natural form were
seen in both the Yakima and the Columbia Valleys. Other pebbles required
but slight shaping to bring them to the required form. <a href="#f22">Fig. 22</a> illustrates
such a pebble which is in process of shaping by pecking or bruising
and <a href="#f43">Fig. 43</a> shows a suitable tool for executing the work. After being fully
shaped by this process such pestles were polished but the materials used for
this purpose, whether sandstones and similar abrasives, the horse tail rush
or the bare hand, are not known.</p>

<h2><a id="C43" name="C43"></a><span class="smcap">War.</span></h2>

<p><a id="C44" name="C44"></a><i>Implements used in Warfare.</i> The objects considered under hunting
on <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a> <i>et seq.</i>, such as chipped points for spears, arrows and knives may
have served in warfare; so also may bows, mentioned on <a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>. Others
that were considered as tools, on <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a> <i>et seq.</i>, such as the celt and hand-adze,
may have been used as weapons in war times; but there are some
objects that were probably useful only in warfare. Prominent among these
are the club-heads and clubs, made of stone, shown in Figs. <a href="#f60">60</a>-<a href="#f68">68</a>. No

<p><a id="C45" name="C45"></a><i>Grooved Pebbles, Club-heads, or Sinkers.</i> The grooved spheroid pebble,
shown in <a href="#f60">Fig. 60</a>, was found on the Yakima Reservation near Union Gap
and is in the collection of Mr. Janeck. There are two encircling grooves
which cross each other at nearly right angles. These have been made by
pecking. At one intersection of the grooves, the object shows signs of battering
such as may have resulted from pounding with it, or such as may
have been made to form a pit for the reception of a handle end. It is probably
a club-head, net sinker or gaming stone<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> similar to those used in the

The spheroid specimen made of hard lava, possibly trap, shown in
<a href="#f61">Fig. 61</a>, was found on the Yakima Reservation near Union Gap, and is also
in the collection of Mr. Janeck. There are three grooves, marking great
circles at right angles to each other. These have been made by pecking. At
each pole or the intersection of two of these grooves, at the top and bottom
in the illustration, and in each area marked out by the grooves is a pit making
a total of ten. In the equatorial grooves are the remains of two parallel
strings, each twisted to the right or contra-screw-wise, made up of two strings
twisted to the left and remains of a fabric of loose mesh overlying the strings.
It measures 70 mm. by 63 mm. by 57 mm.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> A club-head made of stone
with a handle covered with rawhide and horsehair, was seen by us in the
collection of Mr. Janeck. The head is grooved, circular in cross section,
and has conoid ends. It consequently resembles the stone clubs of the eastern
Plains. The objects shown in Figs. <a href="#f14">14</a>-<a href="#f16">16</a> and considered as sinkers,
may have been fastened to handles and used as heads for war clubs or as

handle is oval but approaches a lenticular form in cross section. There are
eighteen notches across one edge of the knob and eight on the other. The
blade is of the characteristic form with lenticular cross section but thicker
than the thin type of stone clubs of this form such as are found near the

<p>The club shown in <a href="#f63">Fig. 63</a> was found in the Yakima Valley on the west
side of the river between Wenas Station and Upper Gap above North
Yakima. It is made of serpentine of a mottled yellow, brown and green
color. It is 26 mm. long, and of the form of a rather thick, elongated apple
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>seed, with the upper and lower ends cut off. The top is of the form of a
symmetrical celt with a dull edge and is bevelled about equally from each
side. The handle, which is 22 mm. thick, is the thickest part of the object,
rather oval in section and merges into the blade, which is paddle-shaped,
lenticular in cross section and terminates in a celt-like end which is dull and
bevelled about equally from each side.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> It is catalogue No. 44 in the collection

as Sand Point, Idaho, the most eastern occurrence, as was mentioned on
p. 413 of my "Archaeology of the Gulf of Georgia and Puget Sound,"

On the west, they seem to range from the Klamath Valley to the head of

thick. The handle is somewhat lenticular, but tends to be hexagonal in
section, with rounded corners and meets the blade abruptly. There is a
saddle-shaped knob at the top with an incised geometric design in the hollow.
The upper part of the right edge of this knob is flat with two incisions across
it, while the lower part is rounded. A stone club with similar handle is
known from Puget Sound.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The specimen is catalogue No. 40 in the collection

338 mm. in length. It is bilaterally symmetrical and the reverse and obverse
are alike. The handle is oval in cross section and terminates in a knob
from which it is separated by a slight groove. In the top of the knob is a
depression as if there had been a hole pecked through the form, tapering
from each side, as in the clubs or slave-killers having lozenge-shaped cross
section from the coast there<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> the top broken off and the broken edges rounded,

<p>The stone club, shown in <a href="#f66">Fig. 66</a>, was found on the surface at Union Gap,
below Old Yakima. It is of a purplish gray lava-like material. The
handle is oval in cross section with a knob at the end which is somewhat
flattened on each side and slopes towards the rounded top like a blunt
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>symmetrical celt. The blade has convex side edges which are nearly flat
and about 18 mm. wide. It is thicker in the middle than at the edges and
bears a mid-rib of the shape of a railroad embankment with rounded angles,
from the handle to the end. On each side of this mid-rib, the surface is
nearly flat. The end of the blade is nearly flat. The specimen is in the
collection of Mr. Janeck.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>It will be noted that the thin stone clubs found here have no mid-rib.
Clubs made of stone, whale's bone or wood with such mid-ribs are unknown
from the coast but are found with median decoration in place of a mid-rib,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>

<p><a id="C47" name="C47"></a><i>'Slave-killers.'</i> A 'slave-killer' or club, made of friable stone shown in
<a href="#f67">Fig. 67</a>, was found on the surface of Union Gap, below Old Yakima.
It is in the collection of Mr. Janeck. The object has a blade which sets
out from the handle and resembles in shape the typical 'slave-killer' in that
it is lozenge-shaped in cross section with bulging sides and rounded angles.
The handle is oval or nearly circular in cross section, and slightly larger at
the top where there is no knob or perforation as in the typical club of this
type.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The object is 377 mm. long, 63 mm. wide, and 41 mm. thick.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
The club or 'slave-killer' made of stone, shown in <a href="#f68">Fig. 68</a>, was found at
Lake Chelan, and is 280 mm. long. It is owned by Mr. C. G. Ridout of
Chelan, Chelan County. The handle terminates in a knob, which resembles
the form of an animal head. This knob is somewhat heart-shaped,
the two lobes possibly representing ears, and the lower tip projects beyond
the handle of the object. One side, the larger surface, stands at about 45
degrees to the axis of the club and is bisected by a deep incision, on each
side of which are two circles, which probably represent eyes. On either
edge of this knob are thirteen incisions. The handle which is nearly circular
in cross section, bears four vertical rows of horizontally arranged incisions
and expands suddenly edgewise to form the blade which, however, on
its upper and lower surfaces is practically continuous with the handle.
The blade is nearly circular in cross section and tapers gradually to a
rather blunt point. The object is probably a ceremonial implement.</p>

<p>The stone objects considered as pestles and shown in Figs. <a href="#f32">32</a> and <a href="#f35">35</a>
may have been used as war clubs. The object made of friable stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
shown in <a href="#f69">Fig. 69</a> was mentioned on <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a> us possibly having been used as a
pestle and again on <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a> as being suitable for use as a whetstone. It
seems most likely, however, that it served as an implement of war or as a
'slave-killer.' It is roughly of the shape of a cigar. The upper end is
nearly flat and circular. From here the object gradually expands for about
half its length and then contracts to a point, being nearly circular in cross
section throughout. It is 208 mm. long, 38 mm. in maximum diameter,
and 19 mm. in diameter at the top. It was found in the Yakima Valley
and is in the collection of Mr. Janeck.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The object considered as a hand-adze
and shown in <a href="#f46">Fig. 46</a>, may have been used as a 'slave-killer.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>No objects considered as daggers or knives and made of antler were
found by us in this region. Although it will be remembered<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> that several,
over 200 mm. in length, were found in the Thompson River region.</p>

<p><a id="C48" name="C48"></a><i>War Costume.</i> The costume indicated on the figure carved in antler,
described under the section of dress and adornment, <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>, referred to in
the discussion of art on <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>, and shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>, may be that of a
warrior as is suggested by the similarity of the headdress to the war-bonnet
of the tribes of the Plains. That the war-bonnet was used in this region
is strongly suggested not only by this headdress but also by those represented
in the pictographs and petroglyphs as well as by the wearing of it by the
modern Indians of this area. This idea is further strengthened by the fact
that the war-bonnet is worn in the Nez Perce region to the east,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> where it
has no doubt been used for a long time, although it may originally have been
derived from the Plains. The Nez Perce sometimes wore streamers with
these war-bonnets. Spinden states that the early Nez Perce war-bonnets
differed from the type used by them to-day, and that exact information
about them is difficult to obtain.</p>

<p><a id="C49" name="C49"></a><i>Fortifications.</i> A so-called "Indian fort" is situated near Rock Creek
about six miles below Rock Lake. It is about a mile south of the ranch
of Mr. Frank Turner (<a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>), and shown in the photographs reproduced
in Figs. 1<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and 2<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>, <a href="#VI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span></a>. These were taken and presented by Mr. J. S.
Cotton, then in charge of the cooperative range work at the Washington
State Experiment Station at Pullman, who furnished from his notebook all
our data on this subject. The "fort" is built on a flat knoll of about fifteen
feet in height and with precipitous sides. It is in the form of a circle, being
enclosed about four fifths of the way around. The wall is built of flat rocks
which are tilted in such a manner that they will glance all projectiles into
the air. There were numerous arrow chip pings within the "fort." There
are many Indian graves supposed to be very old, two pits believed to mark
building sites, and a long line of stones in the vicinity (pp. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>, <a href="#Page_54">54</a>, <a href="#Page_29">29</a>).</p>

<p><a id="C50" name="C50"></a><i>Wounds.</i> The skull of skeleton No. 99-4318, found in rock-slide grave
No. 10 (5) on the north side of the Naches River half a mile above its mouth,
showed where the right side of the orbit had been pierced in such a way that
the malar bone was partly severed and repair had taken place, leaving a
large <a href="#TN">anterior</a> lateral projection on the malar bone. One rib had two articular
surfaces at the anterior end.</p>

<p><a id="C52" name="C52"></a><i>Skins.</i> Tanned skin and skin bearing hair of animals, including the
deer, and feathers of the woodpecker have been found in the graves and
were evidently portions of garments or of pouches; but graves containing
these materials are apparently more modern than some of the others. No
skins of birds were found by us in this whole region. The scrapers mentioned
on page 69 and the hammers as well possibly as the grooved stones
mentioned on pages 30 and 75 may have contributed to the making of
clothing: the former for scraping skins, the latter for beating and softening
them.</p>

<p>Skin (202-8223), resembling buckskin or leather in its decomposed
condition, was found in grave No. 31 (2) (99-4326), in the rock-slide near
the mouth of Cherry Creek, immediately below Ellensburg. That this
grave may not be as ancient as some of the artifacts here described is suggested
by the fact that a small piece of a wooden post, not completely decayed,
was found projecting from the rock-slide above the grave, and by
the presence of four more posts, one at each corner of the grave, extending
down from the level of the rock-slide, the upper parts apparently being
entirely decomposed. The remains of matting which had been wrapped
around the body, glass beads (202-8225) and three bracelets made of iron
(202-8226), one of which is shown in <a href="#f96">Fig. 96</a>, also suggest that this grave
was modern, although it must be remembered that in this dry climate,
wooden posts, matting and iron resist decomposition for a long time. The
form of the garment or other object made up of this skin has not been identified,
but pieces of the skin are joined in some places by over-casting with
skin thread; in others, with a double skin thong and still in others with some
sort of vegetable fibre. A piece of deer skin (202-8230) with the hair on
was found in grave No. 37 (4) (99-4328), in the same rock-slide. Here
again, the presence of sticks about three feet long, decayed at the tops and
arranged in three rows of matting made of reeds (202-8229 and 202-8230,
Figs. <a href="#f71">71</a>-<a href="#f72">72</a>), and of beads apparently made of factory-rolled copper, suggest
that the entire contents of this grave are modern.</p>

<p>Fragments of skin of a small mammal, with the hair on, which had been
stitched along one edge with what appears to be twisted vegetable fibre
made into a cord of two strings (202-8231), was found in grave No. 34 (5)
(99-4329) in the same rock-slide. Here again were found evidences suggesting
the grave to be modern. These consisted of decayed posts cut off
at the surface of the slide. Among the other objects in the grave were
matting (202-8232), beads (202-8233, <a href="#f74">Fig. 74</a>), made of what is apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
factory-rolled copper, coarse string and thong, some of which is wound at
the ends and pieces of coarse twisted plant fibre upon which some of the
beads were strung, two ornaments (202-8234, <a href="#f91">Fig. 91</a>) made of haliotis
shell, two pendants made of what appears to be factory-rolled copper (202-8235),
four bracelets apparently made of similar copper (202-8236, <a href="#f95">Fig. 95</a>),
a square pendant (202-8238, <a href="#f78">Fig. 78</a>), a disk
(202-8239, <a href="#f83">Fig. 83</a>), both of which seem to be
made of factory-rolled copper and a piece of iron (202-8242). Among the rocks above the
grave were found a copper ornament (202-8244), a brass pendant (202-8245, <a href="#f84">Fig. 84</a>),
with thong and copper bead, and a copper pendant (202-8246, <a href="#f82">Fig. 82</a>).</p>

<p><a id="C53" name="C53"></a><i>Matting.</i> Fragments of matting of vegetable
fibre sewed or twined with cords made of plant material were found; but only in
recent graves. Such graves contained objects introduced into the region since the advent of
the whites. These fabrics were probably modern but were in no way affected by the
coming of the white man or the materials secured from him, being simply found in these
modern graves associated with artifacts made from material secured from the white man.
In the old graves they have probably long since decayed. Spindle-whorls were not found.
<a href="#f70">Fig. 70</a> illustrates the stitch of a piece of matting
(202-8391) of a well known type consisting of a single strand warp of rushes pierced
at intervals by the weft which is a two-strand string. It is similar to that commonly found
in the Thompson River region.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> This specimen
was found in grave No. 38 (1) (99-4333) in a rock-slide on the west side of the Columbia
River, near the head of Priest Rapids. The grave was probably modern as is suggested by stakes nearly six feet long
which projected about three feet above the surface of the rock-slide and a
roll of birch bark<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> (202-8392). The vegetable fibre used in sewing these
stalks was probably the same as that used by the present Indians as was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
thought to be the case in the Thompson River region.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Spinden does not
mention this simple type of sewed mat as found in the Nez Perce area.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
<a href="#f71">Fig. 71</a> shows a piece of matting (202-8229) of a new type consisting of
two strands of what seem to be small stalks of tule, twisted loosely and
pierced at each half turn by a cord. The cord is a two-strand string, the
vegetable fibre of the individual strands not seeming to be twisted. The
interstices are wide. It was found under the pelvis of a skeleton of a
youth (99-4228) in a recent grave, No. 33 (4), in a rock-slide near the
mouth of Cherry Creek, below Ellensburg. This piece of matting, so far
as I am aware, is the first specimen of a new type collected and figured.
It was first brought to the attention of students in 1906 through correspondence
when Professor Otis T. Mason stated that he had never seen an
example, a picture or a description of just that technique. It was shown at
the annual exhibition of the New York Academy of Sciences, in December of
the same year, but reference to the type was first published in November
1908 by Spinden.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> In the Thompson River region this type has not been
found. Mr. James Teit informs me that he asked all the old Thompson
Indian women of the vicinity of Spences Bridge about this type of matting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>submitting a model of it to them which I sent him. They all stated that
they never saw that particular type made in the Thompson River region
and if ever made there it must have been before the memory of those now
living. The only pierced matting made there as far as they have ever
known is the tule tent mat,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> but the strands of this were not twisted, being
like those shown in <a href="#f70">Fig. 70</a>. They had a weave similar to this and the same
in general effect in the common mat used for beds and on which to sit,
known as the floor mat, but the strands were woven and not stitched.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
Certain rush bags of the Quinault and the Makah resemble this type of
matting but the rushes are not pierced.</p>

<p>Matting (202-8162) made of tule stalks stitched together with cords
twisted to the right, but made of large stalks was found in a recent grave,
No. 10 (5) in the rock-slide on the north side of the Naches River, half a

similar cords and part was of the more common form of sewed matting
such as is shown in <a href="#f70">Fig. 70</a>. This grave had been rifled, and the presence
of bark, a portion of a fire drill (202-8157), part of a wooden bow (202-8159),
two pieces of a finely woven basket (202-8160) and copper tubes
apparently of rolled copper, suggest that it was modern.</p>

grave No. 33 (4) of a youth in a rock-slide near the mouth of Cherry Creek,
below Ellensburg. Spinden states that mats were made in the Nez Perce
area, of cat-tail stalks held together by two twined cords and that mats were
used for house and floor coverings and as sheets upon which to dry berries.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The string of all these fragments of matting was too much decayed or
fragmentary for determination. It will be remembered that both sewed and
woven matting were found in the graves of the Thompson River region,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
as well as among the living Indians. It seems probable that these mats
were made and used one above the other like great shingles for covering the
summer house, for beds and for wrapping the dead, while the thinner pieces
may have served for garments. Food was probably spread on them to dry
and they no doubt served many other purposes. The art of weaving was
practised to a considerable extent in the Nez Perce region to the east, although
it had very slight development in the Plains area, still further east.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

some twisted to the right, others, to the left and in some cases a single cord
was used for stringing the beads, while in other cases three cords were used.</p>

<p>A roll of birch bark (202-8392) was found in grave No. 38 (1) (99-4333)
in a rock-slide, on the west side of the Columbia River near the head of
Priest Rapids. It is the only specimen of this kind that was found by us in
the whole area although it will be remembered<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
that such rolls of birch bark were frequently
found in graves of the Thompson River region.
As stated on <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>, we considered this grave to
be modern.</p>

<p><a id="C54" name="C54"></a><i>Ornaments.</i> A great variety of ornaments was
found, but most of these were in graves considered to be modern. Among the finds which appear to
be old, none of them having been found in graves considered to be modern, none of them appearing
to be made of commercial material and all of which seem to be of native technique are perforated
disks of stone (202-8152), and bone, (202-8227), a perforated and engraved sea shell (202-8388),
and haliotis shell from the Pacific Ocean (202-8393), both plain and polished dentalium
shells, pendants made of what is apparently haliotis shell, a nose ornament also apparently
made of haliotis shell (202-8252), and beads made of shell.</p>

were not seen by us in this area. Although charcoal, which may have been
mixed with grease and used for paint, was frequently found there was no
evidence of such use.</p>

<p><a id="C55" name="C55"></a><i>Combs.</i> Only one comb was seen and nowhere throughout the area
were found any objects known to have been used as head scratchers such
as were not uncommon in the Thompson River region.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The comb (<a href="#f73">Fig.

an old grave at Fort Simcoe. The teeth are convex in outline, the back is
nearly straight but not quite parallel with the line of the teeth and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
ends convex, the rear end being shorter than the other. The nineteen
teeth (one perhaps being rather wide to be considered) are set out from
each other by grooves on each side of the comb. This edge of the object
is somewhat sharpened making the lower end of each tooth resemble the
shape of a celt or wedge. Near the back of the comb are three perforations,
one in the middle and one at each end, the latter being about equi-distant
from both the back and the end of the comb. The hole near the
short end of the comb was drilled tapering from the reverse, while the two
other holes were drilled tapering part way through from each side, but
slightly farther from the reverse than the obverse. The specimen is in the
collection of Mrs. Jay Lynch at Fort

<p><a id="C56" name="C56"></a><i>Beads.</i> Among beads, some made
of glass are certainly modern. Judging
from these glass beads, others found associated with them or with things
of white manufacture in the same grave are also modern; while some seem
to be old and from sites believed to be ancient. Besides objects truly of
the shape of beads, there are others, as for instance the tubes of copper such
as are shown in Figs. <a href="#f74">74</a> and <a href="#f78">78</a>, some of which were found strung with
simple bead forms. Otherwise, they might possibly not have been considered
as beads. <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> suggests how such tubular beads of copper may
have been worn on armlets and headdresses. In <a href="#f74">Fig. 74</a> are illustrated two
fragmentary strings of several types of beads from a number which were
found on the neck, arms and legs of a skeleton in grave number 34 (5) in a
rock-slide near the mouth of Cherry Creek below Ellensburg. The short
cylinders are sections of dentalium shells, longer sections appearing occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>sionally.
The longest cylinders are sheet copper rolled into cylindrical form.
The lapping edge, in most of the beads illustrated is irregular and varies
in thickness, which suggests that they were beaten out of native copper
rather than cut out of factory-rolled copper. Of course this appearance
might be given to the latter by beating it. Such rolled beads made of copper
are found in the Nez Perce region to the east<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and in the Thompson River
area to the north.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> These shell and copper beads consequently might be
considered ancient from their individual appearance, but on the shorter
string are some more or less spherical beads made of glass which of course
shows that all these beads were used in comparatively recent times. The
beads on the longer string are strung upon coarse plant fiber twisted into
a two strand string while the shorter string is upon a much smaller fiber
also of two strands which are twisted. Some of the other beads in this lot
were strung upon thongs.</p>

<p>The tubular bead shown in <a href="#f75">Fig. 75</a> is made of brass, proving conclusively
that it is recent. It was found in grave No. 1 of the Yakima ridge, which
contained a number of other objects that might characterize the grave as
ancient were it not for the presence of brass beads. A smaller but slightly
shorter brass bead was found with this. It contained a piece of stick, but
this may be merely the remains of a rootlet many of which had penetrated
into the grave. The edges of the outer fold as well as the ends of the
bead are irregular and thinned out similar to the corresponding parts of the
copper beads shown in <a href="#f74">Fig. 74</a>. This suggests that the brass may have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>pounded into sheets by the natives or at least that factory-rolled brass was
pounded by them in manufacturing the bead. It also shows that this
characteristic of the edges of copper objects, while it may suggest that they
were beaten out of native copper and are consequently ancient, does not
prove it. Tubular copper beads with short sections of dentalium shell were
found mixed all the way from the top to the bottom of grave number 10 (5)
in a rock-slide on the north side of the Naches River about half a mile above
its mouth. Some of these were slightly larger than those shown in <a href="#f74">Fig. 74</a>.</p>

The perforated cylinder made of serpentine or steatite shown in Fig. 99 may also have been used
as a bead or ornament instead of for gambling. Shell beads of disk shape such as are shown in
<a href="#f76">Fig. 76</a> were found in three places. Those figured
were among the refuse of a grave in a rock-slide near the head of Priest Rapids. Two were
found in grave No. 7 (4) in a rock-slide on the northern side of the Yakima Ridge. A brass
button and three glass beads were found with them. Twenty-eight of them were found in the
grave of a child in a rock-slide on the west side of the Columbia River near
the head of Priest Rapids. All these beads seem to be drilled from both
sides or at least each end of the bore is slightly larger than the middle.

<p><a id="C57" name="C57"></a><i>Dentalium Shells.</i> Dentalium shells, some broken or cut into short
sections, were found in twelve of the graves of this region. Two of these
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>graves were in domes of volcanic ash and probably old; five of them were
cremation circles, also ancient, while five were rock-slide graves of which
three were surely modern, and two probably so. It will be seen that the
dentalia beads are found in about equal proportions in old and recent graves,
there being seven examples of the former and five of the latter. One lot of
dentalia found in a cremation circle was charred. None of the dentalia
found in the rock-slide graves were incised while in one of the graves in a
dome of volcanic ash incised dentalia were found together with the sculptured
human form in antler shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> on which are represented
what appear to be dentalium shells forming parts of ear or hair pendants.
Incised dentalia were also found in two of the five cremation circles containing
dentalium shells. Some of the incised designs on dentalium shells are
shown in Figs. <a href="#f117">117</a> and <a href="#f118">118</a>. An idea of how the dentalium shells may have
been used as ornaments on arm bands and headdresses may be had by
reference to <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> and <a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>. Somewhat similarly incised dentalium
shells were found at the large burial place at Kamloops in the southern
interior of British Columbia to the north,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and in the Nez Perce region to
the east bits of engraved dentalium shells are found in the graves of children.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Strings of them were hung from the ears or fastened to the braids of hair
and dentalia were attached to the dresses of the women.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Among antiquities
they are found as far east as central Wyoming. There are some dentalium
shells decorated with windings along lines somewhat similar in the
collections from the Hupa of California. Dentalium shells used as nose
ornaments, ear pendants or parts of ornaments and as beads were also
found in the Thompson region.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> A few were found on the coast in the
Fraser Delta,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> but while they are to be seen in collections from living
Indians and recent graves they were not found among antiquities elsewhere
on the coast of British Columbia and Washington.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It seems
noteworthy that while the shells are plentiful on the coast where they
are used by the modern people they could only have been obtained in the
Thompson River region and the Yakima Valley by barter. In the
north, they were imported until recently through the Chilcotin country
from the region north of Vancouver Island.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> In the Yakima Valley, however,
they were probably brought in by a more southern route and from
places further south on the coast. My impression is that the Fraser Valley
was not used as a route for the importation.</p>

bears six notches spaced about equi-distant from each other on one edge, and
that the perforation is irregular, apparently having been broken through

<p>A pendant made of steatite and bearing an incised design in which part
of the lines and holes are colored with red paint (mercury) is shown in <a href="#f119">Fig.
119</a>. This was found on the manubrium of an adult skeleton supposed to
be that of a man, in a grave covered with rocks on a low ridge about two and
a half miles south of Fort Simcoe. The object is not necessarily recent
because the coloring matter being mineral may have lasted a long time. In
outline, it is of the form of a tall truncated pyramid. It is only about 6 mm.
thick and its edges are rounded or somewhat sharp. Across the base of
the side shown in <a href="#f119">Fig. 119a</a> extends a ridge which on the opposite side
of the specimen is raised for only a short distance on the left. The Agency
physician is of the opinion that the grave was very old and that steatite does
not occur near by but that the material must have been brought from Puget
Sound. As the character of the art more closely resembles that of the
Thompson River region where steatite is frequently found, at least in the
form of artifacts, it would seem that the material more likely came from there,
if indeed it was not from a nearer source, perhaps in this very valley. The
specimen is in the collection of Mrs. Lynch.</p>

<p><a href="#f82">Fig. 82</a> illustrates a long pendant made of copper found about one foot
deep among the rocks over grave 34 (5) of an infant in a rock-slide near the
mouth of Cherry Creek below Ellensburg. The perforation at the top is
punched, which together with the fact that glass beads and a piece of iron
were also found in this grave, suggests that the copper is factory-rolled.
The edges are rounded and thinned, possibly by disintegration, to almost
a cutting edge. The thong by which it was suspended is of skin and attached
by being passed through the perforation and looped through a slit in the tip
of the thong. Two somewhat similar pendants, (202-8235a, b) made of
copper, were found near the legs in this same grave. The first is narrow
at the top which is slightly concave in outline, and the perforation is punched.
The sides are nearly straight. The lower end is about three times as wide
as the top and is deeply concave in the middle and convex in outline from
this concavity to the side edges. In each of the concavities is a notch.
These suggest that they are worn out perforations from which other pendants
may have been suspended. The second pendant is of almost the same size
and shape as that shown in <a href="#f82">Fig. 82</a>. It has a somewhat fluted lower end but
this characteristic may be partly the result of worn and decomposed perforations
or merely of decomposition. The perforation at the top was punched
and still retains a fragment of a leather thong. A small triangular pendant
only 18 mm. in length, made of copper, (202-8251) was found inside the
skull of a child in grave No. 37 (8) in a rock-slide near the mouth of Cherry
Creek. It is perforated near the most acute angle and also through the base.
The perforations seem to have been punched and the corners have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
rounded, possibly by decomposition. <a href="#f83">Fig. 83</a> shows a thin disk-shaped
pendant made of copper from the same grave as the one shown in <a href="#f82">Fig. 82</a>.
The perforation near the upper edge is also punched. A fragment of copper
(202-8185) was found in the northwestern part of cremation circle No. 17
(12) on the terrace northwest of the mouth of the Naches River. This may
be a fragment of a copper ornament. It, and the specimen found in circle
No. 15 constitute the only finds of copper which were made in cremation
circles. In its decomposed state it does not look like factory-rolled copper
and may be native. The other fragment (202-8181) found in cremation
circle No. 15 (10) at the same place may be factory-rolled copper. In the
Nez Perce area to the east, small pieces of copper were attached to the
dresses of women.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>The remaining pendants are all made of shell. The one shown in <a href="#f87">Fig.
87</a> is a natural olivella shell with the top of the cone missing and found in
grave No. 39 (1) of a child in a rock-slide near the head of Priest Rapids.
A shell somewhat similar to this made into a bead was found in the Nez
Perce region.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The pendant shown in <a href="#f88">Fig. 88</a> was found in the grave of a
child in a rock-slide west of the Columbia River near the head of Priest
Rapids. It is made of a small marine clam shell (<i>Pectunculus</i>), probably a
young <i>Pectunculus gigantea</i>. The perforation passes through the apex and
has apparently been gouged from the outside. The ribs on the convex
surface of the shell have been nearly effaced by grinding or polishing and
the hinge also seems to have been smoothed so that only slight scars mark
the depths of the teeth. This shell certainly came from the Pacific Coast
either in its natural condition or after having been made into this form. It
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>is the only object made of this kind of shell which I have seen in the whole
northwest. The pendant shown in <a href="#f89">Fig. 89</a> is made of iridescent shell
possibly unio but probably haliotis. If the latter, it must have come from
the Pacific Coast. It was found in the same grave. This grave contained
no objects of white man's manufacture or anything suggesting that it was
modern. A list of its contents will <a href="#TN">be</a> found on <a href="#Page_169">p. 169</a>. This pendant is of
the form of an isosceles triangle. It is perforated through the more acute
angle by a small hole which tapers as if drilled from each side of the object.
The edges of the pendant are rather sharp in places and the lower one is
concave in outline. This object may be compared with the pendant made
of bone, found at Lytton,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> which was considered to be a sap scraper.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>The pendant shown in <a href="#f90">Fig. 90</a>, from grave No. 37 (8) of a child in a
rock-slide near the mouth of Cherry Creek below Ellensburg, is made of
haliotis shell which must have come from the coast and is rectangular in
outline with slightly worn or rounded corners. The perforation at the top
is larger at each end, while the one in the side is much larger on the convex
side and only slightly larger on the concave side than in the middle. This
perforation has been broken out. A somewhat similar pendant but smaller
and with only an end perforation (202-8256) was found together with the
shell pendant described on <a href="#Page_98">p. 98</a> near the lower jaw in the same grave. A
larger pendant of this general rectangular form, with worn or rounded
corners, perforated near the middle of one end, and with a second perforation
lower down (202-8254) was found with this. One perforation is larger at
one side of the object, the other at the other side. Three somewhat similar
pendants or fragments of such pendants, one with the perforation broken
out, another with a single perforation and still another with a double perforation
like the one just described (202-8183) except two dentalium shells
were the only shell ornaments found in cremation circle No. 17 (12) on the
flat northwest of the mouth of the Naches River. These were in the northeastern
part of the circle. In the northern and northwestern parts of cremation
circle No. 15 (10) on this same flat were found a number of such
pendants and fragments of pendants which have only one perforation so far
as can be identified.</p>

<p>A much decomposed and fragmentary piece of shell, apparently of claw
shape with a perforation at the base, several other pieces of similar shape
and two triangular pieces of shell (202-8180-82) all of which were apparently
burned, were found in cremation circle No. 14 (9) at the same place.
A fragment of a shell ornament (202-8189) was also found in cremation
circle No. 21 (16) at this place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>The pendant shown in <a href="#f91">Fig. 91</a> is nearly of disk form and made of
haliotis shell. It is perforated at the more convex edge and was found
with one very much like it in grave No. 34 (5) of an infant in a rock-slide
near the mouth of Cherry Creek. One was near the head and the other
near the pelvis. Another specimen and a fragment of still another (202-8257a,
b) and several other small fragments of decomposed shell (202-8258)
were found near the lower jaw in grave No. 37 (8) in a rock-slide near
the mouth of Cherry Creek.</p>

<p>The pendant or nose ornament shown in <a href="#f92">Fig. 92</a> is made of shell which in
its much decomposed condition appears to be haliotis. This object was
found on the lower jaw of a very much decomposed skeleton of a child in the
same grave. The fact that a piece of copper, apparently factory-rolled,
(202 8251) was found inside the broken skull suggests that this grave was
modern. The object is nearly circular in outline, although slightly wider
than high. The sides have disintegrated or were rounded off, to a rather
sharp edge. There were apparently three perforations near the upper
edge of the object, and it is broken so that it is impossible to see whether
they were perforations for suspension or were made merely as a means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
cutting out a portion of the shell in such a way that it could be clasped on
to the septum of the nose. Portions of this specimen and several other
shell objects, found in the same grave were of a peculiar pink color.</p>

<p>The shell shown in <a href="#f93">Fig. 93</a> was found near the neck at the south side of
an adult skeleton in grave No. 12 (7) covered with pebbles in the bluff on
the north side of the Naches River about 12 miles above its mouth. It has
two perforations and what appears to have been a third perforation now
broken out. A somewhat similar circular shell pendant which appears to
have been made from the shell of the oyster was found with this and is
shown in <a href="#f94">Fig. 94</a>. One of these pendants was at the south shoulder, the
other at the south side of the skull. A piece of wood in this grave suggests
that it may not be an old one and that these disks may have been obtained
from traders. The grave was apparently unique. The lower part of the
inner decoration on each side of the face shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> probably represents
a shell pendant for the ear or hair. Disks of haliotis shells were used
as ear pendants in the Nez Perce region to the east.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p><a id="C59" name="C59"></a><i>Bracelets.</i> Bracelets are shown in Figs. <a href="#f95">95</a> and <a href="#f96">96</a>. The one shown in

the arm of the skeleton found in grave No. 34 (5) of an infant in a rock-slide
near the mouth of Cherry Creek. The presence of glass beads in this grave
suggests that the bracelets may be of drawn copper. They are not made of
wire but seem to be rolled out of rather thick sheet copper. The edges of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>the fold are somewhat irregular but I do not consider that this proves the
material to be native copper. The bracelet shown in <a href="#f96">Fig. 96</a> is one of three
made of iron found in grave No. 31 (2) of a child in a rock-slide near the
mouth of Cherry Creek. The use of armlets of skin decorated with shells
or quills is suggested by the incisions on the arms of the costumed human
figure made of antler shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>. In the Nez Perce region to the
east arm and leg bands were worn<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> while in the Thompson area dentalium

<p><a id="C60" name="C60"></a><i>A Costumed Human Figure.</i> A costumed human figure made of
antler<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> is shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>. It was found in grave No. 25<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> in a dome of
volcanic ash near Tampico. There was nothing to indicate that the grave
was recent and so this gives an idea of the costume, but possibly merely of
ceremonial costume as formerly worn in this region. It apparently shows a
feather headdress like that of the present Indians of the region and as far
east as the Dakotas; the hair dressed and ornamented with dentalium shells,
the arms, body, legs and feet apparently bare and ornamented with ceremonial
paintings and about the waist a fringed apron. The general style
of the costume indicated is unlike that of the northwest coast but resembles
that of the plateaus to the south and the Plains to the east. Above the face
is a zigzag line which may represent tattooing, painting or a head-ring.
Spinden says that tattooing was not practised in the Nez Perce region to the
east<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> but Teit reports it as practised in the Thompson River region<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>he supposed that when applied to the wrists the custom was derived from the
coast tribes.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Head-rings among the Thompson River Indians were decorated
with dentalium shells.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> In the Nez Perce region<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> the face and body
were painted, red and yellow being much used for this purpose. In the
Thompson River area<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> the face and body were painted with several shades
of red, head-bands being painted across the brows.</p>

<p>The zigzag is a common form of decoration of the head-bands among
the Sioux. Above the zigzag arranged in a semi-circular row, are certain
oblong forms which indicate feathers. The middle form, however, is marked
with a circle. Both above and below this row are three incised lines forming
an ark. Based on the outer one of these incisions are isosceles triangles
slightly in relief. If these triangles represent the feathers of the headdress,
they are certainly in the correct position. Between them are incised arks
forming hachure parallel to the arks previously mentioned. Two of these
extend above the tips of the triangles. Beyond this, much of the object is
missing, but to the right may be seen a surface similar to the areas interpreted
later on as hair ornaments. Further evidence of the use of such a
headdress is offered by the red and white pictographs and by the petroglyphs
of this region, samples of which are shown in Plates <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV-XVI</span>.</p>

<p>On each side of the face is what is apparently a hair ornament, perhaps
made of buckskin, which was attached to the rolled up braids or curls of
the front hair on each side of the head and hung down as in this representation.
The three horizontal bands of vertical lines apparently represent
dentalium shells although they may be intended for tubular copper or bone
beads, while the oval figure at the bottom of each of these flaps probably
represents a pendant of haliotis shell. Shell ornaments in the Thompson
River region were sometimes of similar proportions and shape. Such hair
ornaments were used until recently in the Thompson River region to the
north where they were of different types and differed in the richness and
style of their ornamentation. One of the common styles was to cover the
flap of buckskin thickly with rows of the largest dentalia placed vertically
side by side. Mr. James Teit informs me that the outer portion of the figure,
bearing five bands of vertical lines, evidently represents part of the headdress
and the buckskin flaps such as were worn in the Thompson River
region attached to the sides of the head-bands. These were ornamented
generally with dentalia among the women and more commonly with designs
embroidered with quills or made with paint among the men. In the Nez
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>Perce region<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> ear pendants in the form of disks were made from haliotis
shells and strings of dentalia were hung from the ears or fastened to the
braids of hair and dentalia and small pieces of copper were attached to the
dresses of women. These vertical bands, however, may represent the lines
of attachment of additional hair by means of glue covered with lime in which
manner the hair is dressed by some Plains tribes. Below the nose are faint
suggestions of an ornament possibly similar to the shell pendant shown in
<a href="#f92">Fig. 92</a>.</p>

<p>The two ridges, extending from near the chin to the shoulders, seem to
indicate collar bones. The body is thin and narrows downward. Paint
or tattooing, representing the ribs, or the ribs themselves, are indicated
by ridges. There are horizontal hachure on the body above the waist.
The arms are separated from the body by incisions made from both the
front and the back, and the outer edges of the object, being rounded off,
are like portions of a carving. A bracelet, band, or figure painted or tattooed,
on the apparently bare arm is indicated in the middle of each by
vertical hachure connecting pairs of parallel lines. The vertical arrangement
of lines of the horizontal band suggests that these were arm bands,
bearing vertically arranged copper or shell beads, if not dentalium shells
similar to those which are supposed to be represented by the bands of
vertical lines on the headdress on each side of the face. Mr. Teit considers
the bands around the elbows as representing armlets of skin embroidered
with dentalia or quills like those formerly used in the Thompson
River region, although the Indians there were in the habit of painting their
bodies in imitation of clothing. Head-bands were painted across the brows,
fringed kilts or aprons around the middle and upper part of the legs and
fringed short leggings along the lower part of the legs. The fringes were
represented as long. Imitations of wristlets, armlets and anklets were also
painted on the body. As before mentioned, arm and leg bands were worn
by the Nez Perce Indians<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and as indicated by the previously described
specimens, bracelets were worn in the Yakima area. At the wrist is a slight
horizontal incision, where the hand expands somewhat sidewise. The
fingers and thumb are separated by four vertical incisions. Below these
and extending across the body are four horizontal lines, the space between
the two in the middle being slightly wider than the other two spaces. These
lines seem to indicate the upper edge of an apron which is covered by vertical
hachure.</p>

<p>The legs begin at the bottom of the apron from which they are set off by
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>two horizontal incisions. The apron at the outline of the object projects
slightly beyond them. On each leg are five incised isosceles triangles,&mdash;three
at the top and two at the bottom, with their long points extending
towards the knees. At each side of the lower triangles is one line which
seems to represent a continuation of the designs around the legs. On each
triangle are horizontal hachure. On both knees are faint traces of two
concentric incisions, forming figures with rounded corners and bulging sides.
Between these are radiating hachure. Close inside is a concentric incised
line and there may be seen two parallel lines, nearly horizontal, above the
right knee and one below it, and one above the left knee. The triangles
may be considered as pointing from these concentric designs rather than
towards them, and in that case the lines, suggesting the continuation of the
design around the leg, appear at the top instead of the bottom. It does not
seem probable that these triangles represent part of a circular design radiating
from the knees, the sides of which are folded around the legs, but rather
that the two series of triangles extend horizontally. The incisions on the
legs probably represent painting or tattooing, since the designs seem to be
horizontal and to extend all around the legs, while on leggings the patterns
are usually vertical and on a flap at the outer side of the leg, the knee being
disregarded. Catlin<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> figures paintings on the arms and legs of the Mandan
similar to the patterns on this carving. The custom is not rare, especially
in connection with elaborate ceremonial costumes such as are no doubt
represented by this figure. The vertical incisions on the feet probably
represent the toes, or designs painted or tattooed on the feet. These lines
argue against any idea that the feet are encased in moccasins, unless bead or
quill work on, or improbable wrinkles in, the moccasins are indicated by
them. Porcupine quills, embroidery, beadwork and painting on moccasins
were used in the general plateau region of which this is a part.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Lewis suggests<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> that the tribes depending largely on the hunt, would be
better supplied with skins for clothing than those subsisting generally on
fish, and that in most of the plateau region, the scanty vegetation makes
clothing from plant materials difficult, if not practically out of the question.
In this connection, it will be remembered that this carving of antler which
gives us our general archaeological information regarding ancient costume,
comes from the higher or hunting region of the valley. It will also be
remembered that sage brush and other plant materials were used for clothing
in the Thompson River region to the north, where the vegetation is nearly
as scanty as in the Yakima Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>Perhaps some suggestion as to the sex of the individual which this figure
was intended to represent may be gleaned from the fact that in the Nez
Perce region the costume of the men differed greatly from that of the women.
The former wore moccasins, leggings, breech clout, shirt, blanket, and also
the war-bonnet, while the latter wore moccasins, a long loose gown and a
fez-shaped cap made of basketry, also occasionally leggings and less decoration
on their costume than on that of the men. The ornamentation consisted
of fringes, bead and quill work, shells, elk teeth, beads, and copper.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
The men's clothing was decorated with fringes, and some with beads,
porcupine quills and paint. Considering this figure from these facts it
would seem that it was clearly intended to represent a man.</p>

in a rock-slide near the mouth of Cherry Creek. One of them had bound
to its tip a little piece of fabric, another a bit of fur. These may have been
part of a costume or ceremonial paraphernalia.</p>

<p>Of the different articles of clothing worn by the Nez Perce, Lewis says,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
"These are formed of various skins and are in all respects like those particularly
described of the Shoshones." Along the Columbia, the similarity
was not so complete,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> but as far down as the Upper Chinook many articles
described as similar to those of the Shoshone were found.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> All these, however,
they declared were, obtained by trade from other tribes and from
those who sometimes visit the Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> According to Lewis,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> the clothing
and equipment of the Shoshone living on Lemhi and Salmon Rivers in
Idaho were much the same as the Plains type, and it is quite probable
that they had formerly lived farther east. There are two certain indications
that this extensive introduction of eastern clothing took place about the
time of Lewis and Clark's visit. When they went down the Columbia in
1805, they found the women wore quite a different dress, consisting merely
of a breech clout of buckskin with occasionally the addition of a small robe
of skin.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> This is exactly the same dress as was worn by the Chinook women
above the mouth of the Willamette.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> When these explorers returned up the
Columbia the following year they found the Indians particularly the women,
much better dressed, and in the eastern or Shoshone style.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> A few years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>later, Cox<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> mentioned the older type of dress as found only among a few
miserable tribes along the Columbia, above the mouth of the Yakima.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p><a id="C61" name="C61"></a><i>Deformation.</i> All of the skulls secured in this area by our party showed
antero-posterior deformation, although not so extreme as is found in the
Lower Columbia region. Accompanying this in many cases was a concave
depression in the anterior parietal region. The flattening of the head was
practised to a limited extent by tribes living along the Columbia River above
the Chinook, but limited, according to Lewis, almost entirely to the women,
and gradually died out towards the east.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

although a beaver tooth was seen in the cremation rectangle No. 21 (16)
near the mouth of the Naches River.</p>

<p>A number of small tubes, made of bone which may have been used in
gambling, were found here. Four of them, about 42 mm. long and 9 mm.
in diameter, with the ends ground squarely across, but with the edges somewhat
rounded possibly by wear, were found in the east northeastern part
of the bottom of grave No. 10 (5) in a rock-slide on the north side of the
Naches River about half a mile above its mouth. <a href="#f97">Fig. 97</a> shows one of two
other bone tubes of similar size and shape, the ends ground somewhat more
perfectly flat, which were found in grave No. 1, in the rock-slide on the
north side of the Yakima Ridge to the southeast of the Yakima River.
Another bone tube from this same grave (<a href="#f98">Fig. 98</a>) is 43 mm. long and 12 mm.
in diameter, and the ends are ground off flat. This bears nine about equi-distant
incised lines, which run around it in such a way that the lower end
of each line is on the opposite side of the bone from its upper end. It is
charred. Such bone tubes were found at Lytton,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> in pouches in the graves,

<p>The perforated cylinder shown in <a href="#f99">Fig. 99</a>, made of serpentine is 44 mm.
long and 8 mm. in diameter, rounded at the edges and was found in about
the centre of grave No. 10 (5). There are five small pits about equi-distant
from each other around this cylinder near the top, and four near the bottom.
There are two transverse incised lines just below the five pits, and there is
an incision about 12 mm. above the bottom of the specimen, below which
the diameter is perhaps half a mm. greater than at the top. Near the middle
of the object it is pierced by a hole which tapers from each end. While this
object also may have been used in gambling, it seems possible that it may be
an amulet.</p>

<p><a id="C64" name="C64"></a><i>Narcotics.</i> Pipes of seven distinct types were found in this region; a
tube, a simple bowl, a disk with both bowl and stem made in the periphery,
an elbow form, a modern inlaid pipe similar to the typical form of the catlinite
pipe of the Plains, a tomahawk-pipe in stone, and a pipe carved in the
art of the North Pacific coast.</p>

<p>A tubular pipe made of steatite is shown in <a href="#f100">Fig. 100</a>. It was collected
by Mr. Frank N. McCandless from the Yakima Indians. Mr. McCandless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
says the stone differs from that found at the head of Wenatchee Lake, which
is sometimes used for pipes in this region. This pipe is No. 215 in his
collection deposited in the Ferry Museum in the City Hall at Tacoma. It
is 51 mm. long and the bowl has been broken off irregularly, about half of it
apparently having been broken away. The bowl flares rather more abruptly
than is the case in the pipes usually found either in this region or that of the
Thompson River. In this respect it resembles the tubular pipes made of
steatite, found on the coast of British Columbia.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> In outline, it is nearly
straight, while most pipes of this type have bowls convexly curved in a form
characteristic of the type found in the interior of British Columbia and of
Washington. The bowl has been gouged out. There is a ridge or ring
around the pipe where the bowl meets the stem. Oblique incisions slanting
downward from left to right, at an angle of about 45°, mark this ridge,
making it suggest a twisted cord. The end of the stem is similarly marked.
These lines are again mentioned under art on <a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>. The stem expands
from the ridge to the end. The outline of the stem is rather straight or
slightly concave, while most pipes of this type have more slender or nearly
cylindrical stems. The interior of the stem was apparently formed by
whittling. The pipe is stained by tobacco which suggests that while it may
be old, it has nevertheless been recently smoked.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> In the Nez Perce region
to the east the earliest form of pipe, according to Spinden, was doubtless the
straight tubular type.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> One of the pipes figured by him has a flange for a
mouthpiece similar to those found in the Thompson River region, and this
flange is perforated near one end. This particular type of pipe is also found
in Oregon.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> A pipe of this type, but which much more nearly resembles the
typical form of tubular pipe of this region, especially the shorter specimens,
is reproduced in <a href="#f101">Fig. 101</a> from Lewis and Clark.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> This specimen which is
made of green stone and has a stem, was seen among the Shoshone Indians
at the headwaters of the Lemhi River, Idaho, by Lewis, August thirteenth,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>1805. It marks the eastern limits of the occurrence of this type of pipe, so
far as I am aware at present, the short forms having been found at Fulford
Harbor, North Saanich, Sidney<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and Port Hammond,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> on the southern
coast of British Columbia, Damon<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> on the coast of Washington, Lytton<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
in the interior of British Columbia, Umatilla<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and Blalock Island,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> near
Umatilla, both in the interior of Washington. In the Journal for Tuesday,
August 13, 1805, Lewis refers to this pipe, as follows:&mdash;"the chief then lit
his pipe at the fire kindled in this little magic circle ... pointed the stem to
the four cardinal points of the heavens first <a href="#TN">beginning</a> at the East and ending
with the North. He now presented the pipe to me, as if desirous that I
should smoke, but when I reached my hand to receive it, he drew it back
and repeated the same c[e]remony three times, after which he pointed the
stem first to the heavens then to the center of the magic circle smoked himself
with three whifs and held the pipe <a href="#TN">until</a> I took as many as I thought
proper; he then held it to each of the white persons and then gave it to be
consumed by his warriors. This pipe was made of a dense semi-transparent
green stone very highly polished about 2-&frac12; inches long and of an oval figure,
the bowl being in the same direction with the stem. A small piece of birned
clay is placed in the bottom of the bowl to seperate the tobacco from the end
of the stem and is of an irregularly rounded figure not fitting the tube perfectly
close in order that the smoke may pass. This is the form of the pipe.
Their tobacco is of the same kind of that used by the Minnetares Mandans
and Ricares of the Missouri. The Shoshonees do not cultivate this plant,
but obtain it from the Rocky mountain Indians and some of the bands of
their own nation who live further south."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Mr. James Teit informs me that a flange like the end of a spool at the
mouth of the stem of a tubular pipe, makes it of a type which seems to him
peculiarly characteristic of the Thompson River region. In some cases this
peculiarity is carried over into the stems of pipes of the modern or elbow
type, which have wooden stems, as is shown in <a href="#f102">Fig. 102</a>. Mr. Teit has
never seen or heard of tubular pipes from the Thompson River region with
holes through the flanges. It seems possible that the hole in such specimens
as one from Umatilla, Oregon,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> may have been made for the attachment of
ornaments or symbolic material such as feathers or for a cleaner. Ornaments
were sometimes attached to pipes of the elbow type in the Thompson River
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>region. This was done by tying in a hole bored through the hatchet-shaped
piece underneath the shank close to the elbow. Pipes of the simple bowl
type often had an extension at the foot of the bowl, sometimes perforated,
to which ornaments could be attached. On the other hand, the hole may
have been to facilitate attaching the pipe to its wooden stem. The pipes
that have been perforated through the flange,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> however, seem to have too
small a bore for a wooden stem; yet, a pipe of this type with a wooden stem
has been shown in <a href="#f101">Fig. 101</a>. One reason given Mr. Teit by the Indians for
the making of the flange or other thickening at the mouth of the pipe stem
was to prevent the string used in attaching the pipe to the wooden stem
slipping off. According to all of them, wooden stems were always used with
tubular pipes as with elbow and simple bowl pipes; for a person cannot
smoke any kind of stone pipe more than a few draws before it becomes too
hot for the lips. To Mr. Teit's mind, no matter how small the bore of the
pipe, a regular stem must have been used for smoking.</p>

<p>Some tubular pipes are said to have had a flange around the mouth of the
bowl, similar to that on elbow pipes as in <a href="#f103">Fig. 103</a>; but this flange meets
the body of the bowl with an even curve. Mr. Teit does not distinctly
remember having seen such flanged tubular pipe bowls among the Thompson
River Indians who gave him this information, but he saw one specimen at
least, of the elbow type with flanged bowl. He further states that to his
knowledge there is only one part of the country where the <a href="#TN">semi-transparent</a>
green steatite is obtained; that is, on the west side of the Fraser River,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>over twenty miles north of Lytton, which as is well known is at the mouth
of the Thompson River. This stone, when polished and used, takes on a
much darker hue than its original color. The fire may be seen through the
stone of the pipes when smoked in the dark. The bluish gray steatite is the
most commonly employed and it turns black when polished and used. The
Thompson River Indians can usually tell from what part of the country the
stone comes of which any particular pipe is made.</p>

<p>The tubular form of pipe is remembered by the old Indians to have been
in use in the Thompson River region, although not so common as the simple
pipe bowls and elbow pipes, and one was seen in use in eastern Washington
as late as 1896.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> On the other hand, no simple pipe bowls known to be
such, or elbow pipes have been seen among archaeological finds. The bowl
and elbow pipes are affiliated with forms found farther east. This fact
suggests that the tubular pipe was supplanted recently by bowl and elbow
forms brought in from the southeast, or at least from the east. The westward
movement of tribes due to the encroachment of our settlements may
have brought them, or some of them, and they may be patterned after pipes
seen in the hands of fur traders and their Indian employees. The tubular
pipe made of steatite, shown in <a href="#f104">Fig. 104</a>, was purchased from Mr. W. Z. York
of Old Yakima (Old Town), who secured it from Shaw-wa-way, an Indian
known as "Young Chief Aleck," who lives on a ranch three miles south of
Old Yakima. This Indian is known to have frequently visited the Okanogon
region and it is possible that he secured the pipe, decorated as it is, or got
the idea for this particular sort of decoration from that region. This is
suggested by the fact that this particular kind of decoration is common,
especially on more recent ornaments, in the Thompson River region, the
people of which in turn frequently visited the Okanogon country. The
bowl of the pipe is cut squarely across at the end where the outer edge has
been rounded. It is of the typical shape of this form of pipes, and has been
hollowed out by gouging contra-screw-wise. It meets the stem abruptly
and the latter is slightly larger than the base of the bowl, so that it seems
to be separated from it. The stem is very short and cylindrical and the end
is cut squarely off; but it is bevelled on each side so that about one third of
the end is left and the bevelled surfaces extend over half the length of the stem.
This beveling may have been to form the mouthpiece; but it seems more
likely that the pipe had a long stem similar to those found in the Thompson
River region.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> This seems to have been broken off obliquely near the bowl,
then cut squarely across, and the other side bevelled to give bilateral symmetry
because one of these bevelled surfaces appears as if it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>broken and then only slightly smoothed; both of these surfaces and the
square end of the stem seem to have been more recently cut than the rest
of the pipe. These three surfaces seem less polished and as if they were
made with a steel knife. The bore of the stem measures 5 mm. in diameter.
A portion of the bowl is decorated by incised lines into which red paint has
been daubed, suggesting that it was recently applied; while the design itself,
which is further described on <a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a> under the section of art, is of
figures which suggest that it was made lately. Possibly the pipe is old, but
was recently broken and decorated with the incised design and paint.</p>

<p>The fragment of a sculptured tubular pipe made of steatite shown in
<a href="#f105">Fig. 105</a> is apparently about half of the original object. It was found in an
Indian grave about a quarter of a mile from the bank of the Yakima River
at a point about nine miles above its mouth, in August 1902, by Mr. W. F.
Sonderman of Kennewick. Mr. Sonderman's collection from the immediate
vicinity contained glass beads, a metallic handle and buttons, as well as
chipped points. As the contents of the three graves from which he obtained
this collection, during the construction of an irrigation canal were mixed,
it seems that this pipe may belong to the same period as that of the glass
beads and other objects of European manufacture and consequently may
be modern, although it may be an old specimen, deposited in a modern
grave. The general form of the pipe was thought to be that of a cone.
The portion towards the front of the carving, however, is somewhat longer
than that towards the rear, and the back is nearly flat, although this may be
caused simply by the carving. The bore is somewhat smaller at the mouth
of the bowl than lower down. It was apparently gouged out. Some traces
of dirt, perhaps the remains of the material smoked in the pipe may be seen
towards its larger opening. The carving, which represents a human form,
is further described under the section of art on <a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>. As the tubular
form of pipe seems to be common to this region, as well as to the Thompson
River region, further north, it would seem that this specimen may be a
variation from the type or merely one of these pipes made by an artist. It
may be that such sculptured forms of this type of pipe may not be found in
the Thompson River region, and that the carving of tubular pipes in this
way may be characteristic of the Yakima region, although the style of art
suggests that found in the Thompson River region and more especially in
the Lillooet Valley.</p>

<p>Only one specimen of the second or simple bowl type was seen by us in
the whole region. It is shown in <a href="#f106">Fig. 106</a>, and was found near the head of
Priest Rapids by a boy from whom Mrs. J. B. Davidson obtained it for her
collection. She afterwards presented it to our expedition. It is made of
schistose rock, apparently limestone, of gray color with lighter veins. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
object is oval in section, slightly longer than it is wide, and a little wider
than it is thick being 32 mm. long, 29 mm. wide, and 15 mm. thick. If
slightly flatter, this pipe would resemble in shape the third type. The inside
of the bowl which was apparently gouged out, is 13 mm. in diameter; while
the opening for the stem seems to have been drilled. This opening is 7 mm.
in diameter. The rim of the bowl is flattened, and this flat surface resembles
that of the part of a hammerstone used for pecking. This style
of pipe somewhat resembles some of the pipes used by the Thompson River
Indians of the present day and together with elbow pipes, supplemented the
tubular pipe in that region. This suggests them to be more modern than the
tubular pipes in this region where also they are not as numerous. The
type is not found among the archaeological remains in the Thompson region,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>
but Mr. Teit sent one simple bowl pipe to the Museum from a very old grave
at Spuzzum besides two from the Thompson Indians.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The absence of this
form of pipe among archaeological specimens from the areas to the north
and west suggests that the culture of this region is somewhat more closely
related to that further east than are the cultures of the areas further north
and west. The pipe is ornamented with a circle and dot design again mentioned
under the section of art on <a href="#Page_131">p. <ins title="Original page reference: 13">131</ins></a>.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Specimens of the third or disk-shaped type are shown in Figs. <a href="#f107">107</a>, <a href="#f108">108</a>
and <a href="#f109">109</a>. The first, made of sandstone, is from the Snake River Indians,
was a part of Mr. D. W. Owen's collection, and was presented by him to
our expedition. It is nearly of the form of a disk but has slightly bulging
sides, 52 mm. long, 49 mm. wide, and 19 mm. thick. The mouth of the
bowl is 13 mm. in diameter; while the opening for the stem, at right angles
to it, is 9 mm. in diameter. The convex appearance of the sides or ends of
the disk is due to the beveling of these surfaces near their edges. On each
of these sides is an incised design. These are again mentioned under the
section of art on <a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>. The second specimen, shown in <a href="#f108">Fig. 108</a>, is oval
in outline with slightly convex sides. The object is made of blue stone and
was found in the Yakima Valley. It is about 52 mm. long, 41 mm. wide,
and 19 mm. thick. Parallel scratches on the surface suggest that it was
brought into shape by grinding with a piece of sandstone, although these
marks may be interpreted as those made with a file. The opening in the
bowl tapers evenly towards its base, from one of the longer edges of the
discoid; while the somewhat longer drilling for the stem from one of the
shorter edges of the disk, at right angles to the bore of the bowl, is of nearly
the same diameter throughout. The specimen is in the collection of Mr.
Louis O. Janeck of North Yakima.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The third specimen of this type which
is shown in <a href="#f109">Fig. 109</a> is No. 155 in the collection of Mr. Janeck, and was also
found in the Yakima Valley. It is made of stone resembling quartzite in
appearance and is of a waxy, yellowish brown color. It is nearly circular
in outline, almost flat on the rim, and the sides are somewhat convex. It
is 45 mm. long by 40 mm. wide and 19 mm. thick. The bore of the bowl
is 16 mm. in diameter at the mouth, and is somewhat larger than that of the
stem, which is 10 mm. in diameter at its end, and at right angles to the bowl.
Each bore tapers from its outer opening to the point of juncture. In the
Nez Perce region to the east near Asotin city, this disk-shaped type of pipe
is found.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Mr. Fay Cooper Cole of the Field Museum of Natural History
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>believes the Tlingit have a variation of this type of pipe and that it is also
found in California. Its occurrence in Oregon is mentioned by Moorehead.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>The fourth or rectangular bowl type is shown in Figs. <a href="#f110">110</a>, <a href="#f111">111</a> and <a href="#f112">112</a>.
The first shows the axis of the bowl and that of the stein, at nearly, if not
exactly, a right angle. The specimen is in the collection of Mr. York, and
is made of soft grit or sandstone. The outer opening of the bowl is somewhat
larger than that of the stem. There was a band around the bowl,
made up of a single thickness of thread which is not shown in the figure.</p>

<p>The second of these specimens, shown in <a href="#f111">Fig. 111</a>, is a simple elbow pipe
with the angle between the axis of the bowl and the stem, slightly greater
than 90 degrees. It is also in the collection of Mr. York and is made of
steatite, which he calls Wenatchee pipe stone. The outer opening of the
bowl is slightly larger than that of the stem. The third specimen, shown in
<a href="#f112">Fig. 112</a>, is also of the simple elbow type and the axis of the bowl is nearly
at right angles to that of the stem. It is in the collection of Mr. York, and
is made of soft grit or sandstone of a yellowish gray color. In the Thompson
River region to the north, according to Mr. Teit, there seems to be little
doubt but that the tubular pipe has been supplanted by the simple bowl and
elbow types.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> This change may have been brought about by the copying
of the early trader's pipes but Mr. Teit believes it more likely to have come
from influence from the southeast, passed from tribe to tribe about the same
time as the advent of the horse or a little later. The Thompson River
Indians tell him that the tubular pipe continued to be the one in common use
as long as native tobacco only was used, but after the introduction of manufactured
tobacco the elbow type came to be exclusively used because very
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>much better adapted for holding the latter kind of tobacco. In the Nez
Perce region to the east, pipes with rectangular bowls were found.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> One of
these bowls has an incised design representing a tomahawk, which with the
character of other incisions on it suggest that it is modern. Only two finds
of elbow pipes have been reported on the coast. These,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> which were of
fragments, were said by Mr. Edmond Croft to have been found by him in a
shell heap near Markham on Grey's Harbor, Washington. They are made
of fine-grained sandstone of a gray color. Both were apparently intended
to be used with a wooden stem and one of them has a ventral mid-rib from
the mouth of the stem nearly to the base of the bowl which reminds one
somewhat of a similar appendage on the pipe from the Yakima Valley
shown in <a href="#f113">Fig. 113</a> and one from the Thompson Indians.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> My supposition
has been that they reached the coast recently from this general region possibly
by way of the Columbia or were taken there by employees of the fur
companies in early historic times.</p>

<p>The fifth type is illustrated by the specimen shown in <a href="#f128">Fig. 128</a>. It is
the only specimen of this type which I have seen from the region. It is now
in the collection of Mrs. Jay Lynch at Fort Simcoe who obtained it from
Chief Moses. It is made of black steatite which Mrs. Lynch calls Wenatchee
pipe stone, inlaid with white metal and has a wooden stem. It is comparatively
modern as is shown by the presence of inlaid white metal. The
mouth of the bowl is 18 mm. in diameter, but tapers suddenly, the rest of
the bowl cavity being nearly cylindrical. The opening for the wooden stem
is 11 mm. in diameter, and also tapers suddenly to a nearly even bore. It
is of the same form as many of the pipes made of red pipe stone (catlinite).
This form of pipe is found throughout the Minnesota-Dakota region. This
specimen, however, bears four carvings, which together with the inlaid white
metal design are further mentioned under the section of art on pp. <a href="#Page_118">118</a> and
<a href="#Page_135">135</a>. It would seem that this type of pipe belongs to the region further east,
and as no ancient pipe of this form has been found in this whole region, as
well as from the fact that this specimen marks the most westerly occurrence
of this form, so far as we know, we may conclude that it was introduced from
the east in comparatively modern times. The type of carving, however,
may be of more local origin. The bringing together of several animal forms
may be associated with the idea of the totem poles found to the west; but
no more so than the wooden pipe stems of the Plains which the general
character of the carving more closely resembles.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> In this connection, it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>be well to remember that in the Nez Perce region, catlinite for pipes seems
to have been acquired from the Plains tribes.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> A pipe made from stone
found in the Cascade Mountains of Washington, is in the collection of Mr.
C. G. Ridout, of Chelan, Washington, who states that it has a representation
of a bear and a man on the shaft back of the bowl.</p>

</div>

<p>A specimen of the sixth type is shown in <a href="#f113">Fig. 113</a>. It is the only one of
this style which I have seen in the whole region, and was obtained from a
Yakima Indian. It is in the collection of Mr. McCandless. It is made of
steatite, which Mr. McCandless calls "sandstone from the northern part of
Wenatchee Lake." The form of the pipe seems to be a conventionalized tomahawk pipe. The bowl is circular
in section and somewhat urn-shaped and rests upon the part that is drilled for the stem and which is
rather square in cross section with slightly convex sides. Projecting from the lower part of this is the form which
represents the tomahawk blade. It is wider at its convex edges than where it joins the base of the stem part.
Its three edges are flat, and it is of about equal thickness throughout. The pipe is somewhat stained by
tobacco. It seems likely that this was modelled after the metal hatchet, tomahawk or tomahawk pipe, introduced
by the traders,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> being a rather modern pipe, since
such objects do not seem to have been used in early
times in the great plateau region according to Lewis.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>The seventh type is illustrated in <a href="#f127">Fig. 127</a>. The
specimen is the only one of the style which I have seen from this whole
region and so closely resembles in its carving the work of the Kwakiutl,
Haida and Tsimshian Indians of the coast to the northwest, that I am
inclined to believe it was brought in as a gift or by trade. The material is
apparently soft slate, but is rather light in color, possibly having been
burned. Its appearance suggests that it is the same as that used by the
Haida Indians on the Queen Charlotte Islands, for the carving of such
things as dishes, miniature totem poles, and pipes. The pipe is made up of
carvings representing among other things a bird, a human form and a
human face, which are more fully described under the section of art on <a href="#Page_136">p.
136</a>. This specimen was found two feet deep in earth at one side of a grave
in a little hillside on Toppenish Creek, four miles southeast of Fort Simcoe.
Above the earth were rocks, and the grave was marked by a circle of stones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>In the grave were found elk teeth, and a sea shell, filled with a blue powder,
evidently paint, and covered with what appears to be gut or a bladder-like
skin. What is described as a silver coin, afterwards lost, was found with
this pipe. It is possible that it may have been a silver disk or medal. The
bowl of the pipe, which was gouged out, is in the middle of the carving,
and the tube for the reception of the stem projects from the end under the
human form. The upper part of the human figure is broken off. A hole
was drilled in the opposite end of the pipe through the lower part of the
bird form, but if it had any connection with the bowl, this is not now discernible.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
The specimen shown in <a href="#f59">Fig. 59</a> and considered as a mat presser
reminds one of an unfinished pipe.</p>

<h2><a id="C65" name="C65"></a><span class="smcap">Art.</span></h2>

<p>The graphic and plastic art of the early people of this region is illustrated
by pictographic line paintings in red and white on the basaltic columns of
the cliffs;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> petroglyphs of the same general style pecked into similar cliffs;
incised designs on stone, bone, antler and dentalium shells, and carvings
both incised and pecked in stone. Some of the objects found are colored
by red ochre or have it rubbed into the lines of their incised designs. Examples
of graphic art seem to be more common than those of plastic art.</p>

<p>The paintings and pecked designs on cliffs are more or less geometric
although pictographic in character. The incised designs are still more
geometric and include the circle and dot commonly found in the Thompson
River region.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> This design is also common on modern objects from the
coast of British Columbia and Washington, but was not there present among
archaeological finds. Lewis<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> states that according to the early writers, in
the general area of which this is a part, porcupine quills were much used for
decorating articles of clothing and that later, beads were used for this purpose.
The modern designs are largely floral. Among the Nez Perce,
floral and plant designs in beadwork are particularly common although
some geometric designs occur, as on belts, the decoration of which is largely
geometric, as squares, triangles and similar figures.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Lewis<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> believes that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>the designs of the general region were originally geometric and that some of
the modern geometric designs are survivals, while others suggest eastern
influence. He further states that floral designs are found among the Salish
tribes but to a much less extent. We found no floral designs among the
archaeological specimens in the Yakima area. Some of the incised work,
on certain of the carvings is of good technique, and artistic execution. This
is noticeable in the object made of antler, carved on one surface to represent
a human figure in costume, shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> and on the dish shown in <a href="#f116">Fig.
116</a>. Inlaying with white metal was practised in comparatively modern
times. Animal heads are represented by the specialization of knobs on
pestles, an animal form by a mortar and human forms by some of the pictographs,
and petroglyphs, the incised antler figure and several of the pipes.</p>

<p>Many of the representations are realistic, others are highly conventional.
Some conventional representations are explained by similar figures. For
instance, the radiating lines of the pictographs shown in <a href="#XVI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI</span></a> are
probably explained satisfactorily by similar figures in <a href="#XI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>, Fig. 2</a>,
such radiations on the costumed figure in antler shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> or by the
feather headdresses worn by the present natives. Spinden states that in the
Nez Perce region, realistic figures are probably of recent origin.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> One of
the carvings is clearly of the art of the northwest coast, from which the
object or the artist who executed it must have come. Some of the pictographic-geometric
and conventional figures probably represent guardian
spirits and illustrate dreams done in symbols. A few art forms are evenly
spaced on objects but only a few are distorted to fit the shape of the field.
Pictographic symbols and conventional figures may be placed in groups to
form designs as in the arrangement of the circles and dots on the pipe shown
in <a href="#f106">Fig. 106</a>.</p>

<p>In general, the art of the region tends toward line work of geometric and
a slightly pictographic nature. It shows little resemblance to that of the
coast, but a strong relationship to that of the Plains. The decorative art of
the Nez Perce region includes motives from the Plains and also from the
Pacific Coast.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Some of their designs partake strongly of motives from the
Plains, while here in the Yakima Valley there are perhaps more examples
of coast art and still much influence from the Plains. Spinden says that in
early times the Nez Perce were very poor in decorative ideas and that the
richness and variety found in their modern art may be ascribed to the absorbing
of ideas from other cultures. This is perhaps equally true of the Yakima
region where the influence of coast art in proportion to that from the Plains
is perhaps greater than in the Nez Perce region.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p><a id="C66" name="C66"></a><i>Paintings.</i> Pictographic line paintings somewhat geometric in character,
made on the basaltic columns on the west of the mouth of Cowiche Creek,
on the south side of the Naches River, about four miles northwest from North
Yakima, are shown in Plates <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#XIV">XIV-XVI</a></span>. These pictures, some in red, and
some in white, were probably painted with mineral matter mixed with
grease. Their antiquity is unknown. In the Nez Perce region to the east,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
pictographs in red, yellow and black occur, while in the Thompson River
area<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and in the Lillooet Valley,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> pictographs in red are found. Some of the
Yakima pictographs have been destroyed during the construction of the
irrigation flume which runs along the top of this cliff. Others are partly
covered by the talus slope. All those remaining, are here represented by
those reproduced in the plates. They extend from the top of the talus slope
upward a distance of perhaps five feet. Many of them are indistinct, and
appear more easily seen, if they are not actually clearer, in the photographs
here reproduced than in the originals. Many of the paintings represent
human heads and headdresses and one of them the whole figure with such a
headdress. These headdresses may be compared to similar designs in the
petroglyphs (<a href="#XI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span></a>) at Sentinal Bluffs, thirty-three miles to the northeast
(<a href="#XII">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span></a> and <a href="#XIII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span></a>) at Selah Canon, eight miles to the
northeast and the headdress pecked on the grooved net sinker shown in
<a href="#f14">Fig. 14</a>. Also, taken together with the pictographs representing the full
figure with similar headdress shown in <a href="#XIV">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV</span></a>, may be compared
to the petroglyphs of men each with a headdress among those at Sentinal
Bluffs, the human figure with a headdress carved in antler found near
Tampico, only fourteen miles to the southwest and shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>,
petroglyphs which apparently represent human forms somewhat similar to
this, on Buffalo Rock, in the Nez Perce region to the east<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and the quill
flattener carved to represent a human form with headdress or hair from the
Dakota shown in <a href="#f122">Fig. 122</a>.</p>

<p>The human figure with feather headdress indicated by ten lines shown
in <a href="#XIV">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV</span></a> is all in red. It is the next to the westernmost pictograph
at this site. It is 457 mm. high, the ends of the legs are 279 mm. apart,
the tip of the arms 254 mm., the width of the headdress 229 mm. and the

<p>Mr. G. R. Shafer informed me that he knows of painted rocks in the
Teton River Valley, 20 miles above the Nelson Bridge, which crosses the
Naches a short distance above the mouth of Cowiche Creek. Mr. W. H.
Wilcox of North Yakima stated to me that there are pictures on rocks on the
west side of the Columbia River ten miles south of Wenatchee. Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
refers to painted and "carved" pictures on the perpendicular rocks between
Yakima and Pisquouse. According to Mallery, "Capt. Charles Bendire,
U. S. Army, states in a letter that Col. Henry C. Merriam, U. S. Army,
discovered pictographs on a perpendicular cliff of granite at the lower end
of Lake Chelan, lat. 48° N., near old Fort O'Kinakane, on the upper Columbia
River. The etchings appear to have been made at widely different
periods, and are evidently quite old. Those which appeared the earliest
were from twenty-five to thirty feet above the present water level. Those
appearing more recent are about ten feet above water level. The figures
are in black and red colors, representing Indians with bows and arrows, elk,
deer, bear, beaver, and fish. There are four or five rows of these figures,
and quite a number in each row. The present native inhabitants know
nothing whatever regarding the history of these paintings."<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Apparently
only paintings are meant.</p>

<p>Red ochre is rubbed in the circle and dot designs and the grain of the
stone of the pestle shown in <a href="#f30">Fig. 30</a> and also in the incised lines on the pipe
shown in <a href="#f104">Fig. 104</a>. Red paint (mercury) partly fills some of the holes and
lines on the pendant made of steatite shown in <a href="#f119">Fig. 119</a>. Because of the
mineral nature of this paint, it may have remained a long time and its presence
does not necessarily prove that the supposedly old grave in which the object
was found is recent. Red paint also fills the circles and dots in the slate
object shown in <a href="#f120">Fig. 120</a> while vermilion paint is found in the grooves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>of the animal form shown in <a href="#f125">Fig. 125</a> and as this is probably a mineral which
would be rather enduring, it does not indicate that the painting was recently
done.</p>

<p>Painting was done on moccasins in the general plateau area of which
this is a part.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Spinden states that in the Nez Perce region the natives
depended upon minerals for dyes, except in the cases of a wood, which
produced a brown dye, and rock slime which produced green<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and that
white, red, blue and yellow earth paints were obtained by them further east
from the vicinity of the Grande Ronde Valley;<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> also, that rock surfaces were
painted over with brown as a field upon which to peck petroglyphs.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> In the
same region moreover, white clay<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> was used for cleaning clothing.</p>

<p><a id="C67" name="C67"></a><i>Petroglyphs.</i> The petroglyphs pecked into the weathered surface of the
basaltic columns found in this region, are similar in style to the paintings,
being largely line designs of geometric or conventional representation together
with a few realistic figures. The pictures are formed by pecking
away the weathered surface and exposing the lighter color of the basalt
below. Some of them may be very old, but the bruised surfaces making up
the lines are not weathered very much in comparison with the surrounding
rock surface and yet there is no history of their manufacture. In the Nez
Perce region<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> such pecked pictographs are also found, some of them being
upon fields painted brown.</p>

<p>In <a href="#XI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span></a> are shown petroglyphs on the vertical basaltic columns on
the eastern side of the Columbia River at Sentinal Bluffs, immediately above
Priest Rapids. They are at the base of the cliffs shown in <a href="#V">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span></a>. Those
shown in Fig. 1 are to the east of the road which runs along a notch blasted
in the top of the columns that rise from the river at this point, while those
shown in Fig. 2 are about fifteen feet to the southwest on the columns that
rise shear from the river.</p>

<p>Some of those shown in Fig. 1<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> represent human figures each with a
feather headdress which may be compared with that of the antler figure
found at Tampico (<a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>) and the pictographs of Cowiche Creek. This
place is only about 47 miles northeast from Tampico, and 33 miles in the
same direction from the mouth of Cowiche Creek. One of these is shown
in Fig. 2.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The long form in the centre has a headdress which taken with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>its shape reminds us especially of the human form in antler from Tampico.
The general shape of the body and the row of dots on each side edge suggest
a resemblance to the quill flattener made of antler from the Dakota shown
in <a href="#f122">Fig. 122</a>. On each side are human heads, each with a similar feather
headdress that might be interpreted as rising suns with eyes and mouths.
On the left are some similar figures without eyes and mouths. Below, is a
horizontal figure resembling five links of a chain. There is also a goat which
resembles the two pecked in a granite boulder near Buffalo Rock in the
Nez Perce area, eighteen miles above Lewiston on the east bank of the
Snake River.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The star at the bottom, the rays of which end in dots, a
small oval with radiating lines at the left, and two connected ovals with
radiating lines at the top, remind us of the stars at Selah Canon, shown in
<a href="#XII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span></a>, the petroglyphs near Wallula Junction, shown in <a href="#XIII">Fig. 2,
Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span></a>, somewhat similar figures on the large petroglyph at Nanaimo<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
and perhaps even more than of the Nanaimo figures, those in the petroglyphs
beyond Nanaimo at Yellow Island, near Comox.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> However, the two
connected ovals with the radiating lines may represent hands of a human
figure with a headdress having radiating feathers. All of these headdresses
remind us of the others at this place shown in Fig. 1, the rising suns at Selah
Canon next described, the pictographs at the mouth of Cowiche Creek, and
the incised human form in antler.</p>

<p>In <a href="#XII">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span></a> and <a href="#XIII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span></a> are shown petroglyphs which appear
fresher and whiter or yellower than the naturally weathered reddish basaltic
columns into which they are pecked. They are on the north side of Selah
Canon about one and a half miles from the Yakima River at a point about a
mile north of Selah station or one half a mile south of the intake of the
Moxee Canal. It is about twenty-five miles west southwest of Sentinal
Bluffs, eight northeast from the mouth of Cowiche Creek and twenty-two
miles northeast from Tampico. They are more easily made out from a
distance than close by.</p>

<p>The petroglyph shown in <a href="#XII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span></a>, is the most northeasterly of
the group. This seems to be made up of circles with a dot in the middle and
radiating lines, some of which end in dots. They remind us of some of the
same series of figures as the oval with radiating lines at Priest Rapids.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The one shown in Fig. 2, is about eight feet to the southwest and a little
lower down. The upper part of the left figure and the two main parts on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>the right, each consisting of a curve with short radiating lines like a representation
of the rising sun, may be compared with the top of the petroglyph
on the rocks a few feet to the southwest shown in <a href="#XIII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span></a>, next
described, and with some of those at Sentinal Bluffs, shown in <a href="#XI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span></a>;
also, with the pictographs at the mouth of Cowiche Creek.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>The petroglyph shown in <a href="#XIII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span></a>, is a few feet southwest of
those shown in <a href="#XII">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span></a>, taken from the south. The segment with radiating
lines like the rising sun at the top reminds us of similar figures among the
other petroglyphs here just described, those at Sentinal Bluffs and pictographs
at the mouth of Cowiche Creek, but the other lines are not interpreted
and are not suggestive to us of other figures in the neighborhood. A small
figure, similar in that it consists of two nearly vertical lines crossing each
other and topped by a curved line, shows very faintly above, a little to the
right.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> A design similar to the part of some of these pictures interpreted as
representing a headdress was also found pecked in the surface of the grooved
net sinker shown in <a href="#f14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>The petroglyph shown in <a href="#XIII">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII</span></a>, is pecked on the top of a
rock which projects about three feet from the surface of the ground near
mile post 209 between it and 210 above the Spokane branch of the O. R. &amp; N.
on the south side of the Columbia River about four miles west of Wallula
Junction and is here illustrated as one twentieth of the natural size, from
a tracing made by Mr. J. P. Newell, of Portland, assistant chief engineer
on that road. We are indebted to Mr. W. E. Elliott of New York City,
formerly engineer with Mr. Newell for permission to copy this tracing.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
The top of the rock forms an east and west ridge. The pecked grooves are
all of about equal depth and there are no other petroglyphs on the rock.
The large figure at the left reminds us of the dog-like figures with "spines"
in the petroglyphs at Nanaimo,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> on Vancouver Island, especially as it has
waved parallel lines, a fin or "spine" and two concentric curves at the top
similar in shape to the lines indicating the back of the head and the mouth
of the Nanaimo figure. This is less suggestive of certain harpoon points
that are incised apparently to represent fish found in the main shell heap in
the Fraser Delta at Eburne<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> although Eburne is nearer than Nanaimo and
en route, and although these harpoon points have parallel lines, a fin-like
projection and two lines representative of the back of the head or cheek and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>the mouth. The small circles some with lines radiating from them, remind
us of similar marks on the same large petroglyph at Nanaimo and even more
so of the petroglyphs beyond Nanaimo at Yellow Island near Comox.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
The large figure on the right reminds us of the human form of the petroglyph
at Nanaimo.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>I am informed by Mr. Owen that there is a petroglyph on the north side
of the Columbia River below Kennewick and that it has been destroyed by
recent railroad construction; by Mr. W. H. Willcox of North Yakima that
there are petroglyphs or pictographs on the rocks ten miles south of Wenatchee
on the western side of the Columbia River; and by Prof. Mark
Harrington that it is said that there are "engravings" on the cliffs overhanging
Lake Chelan. Mallery<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> refers to etchings at the lower end of Lake
Chelan but his information seems to refer to painted figures only (See <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>).
The late Prof. Israel C. Russell informed me that there are etchings close
to the river on both sides in the Snake Canon at Buffalo Rock in the extreme
southeast corner of the state of Washington.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p><a id="C68" name="C68"></a><i>Incised Designs.</i> Among the designs incised on stone, attention may be
called to the top of the pestle made of steatite shown in <a href="#f35">Fig. 35</a>, which bears
two parallel longitudinal incisions and notches, ten on the left and eleven
on the right of each side edge of the obverse. There are fifteen fine incisions
running obliquely down from the notches on the left to the first longitudinal
incision. They begin at the eighth notch from the bottom and extend to the
lower notch. On the reverse are three longitudinal incisions apparently
more recently made, and eleven notches on each side edge. This incised
knob is said by the Indians to represent the head of a snake. On the
reverse of the steatite object, possibly a mat-presser, shown in <a href="#f59">Fig. 59a</a>, is
an incised pictographic sketch which unfortunately, with the exception
of the nine short lines above, was re-scratched by its owner. It is reproduced
in <a href="#f59">Fig. 59b</a>. The first figure beginning at the left possibly represents
a tree. The middle figure has not been identified but it is clear that the one
on the right represents a human being. On the left of the groove in the
object are incised two hands pointing towards the left. These also were
re-cut and are not reproduced in <a href="#f59">Fig. 59</a>. The incision in the edge of the
top of the club shown in <a href="#f62">Fig. 62</a> and the incisions at right angles to this were
probably intended for decorative purposes. There is an incised design on
the rounded surface of the saddle-shaped hollow of the club shown in <a href="#f64">Fig. 64</a>.
This design is made of transverse notches above and a zigzag line below.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>The upper part of the right edge of this knob is flat with two incisions across
it. Incised lines arranged parallel to each other in rows may be seen on the
handle and knob of the club shown in <a href="#f68">Fig. 68</a>. There are thirteen of these lines on either edge
of the knob. The other incisions are arranged in four vertical rows on the handle. The lines
on the top of the shell pendant shown in <a href="#f88">Fig. 88</a> may be merely the depths of the teeth rather
than incisions artificially made, but in this case they may have been considered as decorative
and the shell may even have been chosen because of these lines. There are nine incised
lines on the bone tube shown in <a href="#f98">Fig. 98</a>. These run around it in a spiral direction in
such a way that the lower end of each line is on the opposite side from the upper end.</p>

<p>The three transverse incisions on the top of the steatite specimen shown in <a href="#f99">Fig. 99</a> may be
for decorative purposes or merely as tallies as also the five small drilled pits arranged about
equi-distant from each other around the top and the four similarly arranged near the
bottom.</p>

</div>

<p>Incised designs on dentalium shells are shown in Figs. <a href="#f117">117</a> and <a href="#f118">118</a>. The
first four were found under the skeleton in grave No. 25. This skeleton was
of a child and was surrounded by a stone cyst buried in a dome of volcanic
ash near Tampico, as shown in <a href="#X">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span></a>. This lot
contained two shells ornamented with designs of the
type shown in <i>a</i>, but in the one not figured the diamond
points met and formed a checker pattern. There were
four of the type shown in <i>b</i>, one of the type shown in
<i>c</i>, and two like the type shown in <i>d</i>. The specimens
shown in <a href="#f118">Fig. 118</a> were found among broken and
charred human bones of about twelve individuals in cremation circle No. 15 (10) on the terrace northwest
of the mouth of the Naches River. While there was
only one specimen of the type shown in <i>a</i>, there were two of the type shown
in <i>b</i>, and one like the four represented by <a href="#f117">Fig. 117b</a>. Another cremation
circle containing incised dentalium shells is known as No. 18 (13) and was
located on the same terrace. The specimens are mere fragments, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
them, from the tip of the shell, bears a design similar to that shown in
<a href="#f117">Fig. 117b</a>, the other bears a simple incised spiral, the space between one
incision and another being about equal to the width of the incision itself.
The character of both the technique and the motive of these designs resembles
that of those found on similar shells at Kamloops in the Thompson

<p>The incised design on the pendant made of steatite (<a href="#Page_94">p. 94</a>, <a href="#f119">Fig. 119</a>)
does not seem to differ greatly in technique or motive from other incised
designs found in this area and in the Thompson River region to the north.
While most of the lines and pits can be considered as forming symmetrical
or geometric designs, the central figure on the side shown in <a href="#f119">Fig. 119b</a> may
be interpreted as a conventional representation of a life form, namely, a
fish. Red paint is rubbed into some of the lines and pits.</p>

<p>The human figure described under costume (<a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>, <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>) is a somewhat
conventionalized realistic form indicated by incisions on one surface
of a piece of antler 2 to 5 mm. thick.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> It was found in the grave of an
infant under the vertebrae, No. 25 in a dome of volcanic ash. It is of
good technique and artistic execution. The eyes are of the shape of a par<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>allelogram
with rounded corners. These, with similarly shaped figures on
the headdress or inner hair-rolls, and on the hands, knees, and insteps,
slightly resemble a motive common in the art of the coast to the northwest.
The crescent-shaped mouth and thick lips are indicated by incised lines,
while the cheeks are full, and the entire head is somewhat set out in relief
from the rest of the object. The radiating figures above the head do not
represent feathers in a realistic way, but closely resemble the conventional
paintings made by the Dakota on buffalo robes. These paintings have
been called sun symbols, but are interpreted by the Dakota as the feathers
of a war-bonnet or other headdress. The fingers and thumb are set off
from the palm by two lines, which, with the mark at the wrist, make a
figure resembling the eye-form so common in Northwest coast art. The
concentric design on the knees is probably related to the wheel, sun, or
spider-web pattern common as a symbol on the shirts, blankets, and tents
of some Plains tribes. The feet jutting out at the sides are slightly wider
than the legs. The inside of the foot is straight with the inside of the leg,
while the outer part is curved. The two, taken together with the lower
portion of the legs, resemble a divided hoof. The divided hoof is a common
design among Plains tribes.</p>

<p>There are only two specimens, of which I am aware, that resemble this.
One (T-22107, 177 II) consists of seven fragments of a thin piece of antler
found by Mrs. James Terry at Umatilla, Oregon, only about 83 miles in a
southerly direction from Tampico. The back of this specimen is largely
disintegrated, except on the two dog heads, and these being only about 5
mm. thick suggest that the whole figure was thin. The carving (<a href="#f123">Fig. 123</a>)
is in much greater relief than in the specimen from Tampico, although some
of the lines are merely incisions. The tongue projects between, but not
beyond, the lips. The cheeks are raised and there is considerable character
to the face. The nose is aquiline and narrow, but the alæ are indicated.
The orbits are sunken and horizontal oblong pits evidently indicate the eyes.
The eyebrows are raised. Two horizontal incisions extend across the brow.
Below the chin, at the left, are four incisions in a raised piece. This seems
to represent a hand held with the fingers to the neck. A similar hand was
probably at the right. A foot, with four toes in relief projecting above the
brow as high as do the eyebrows, rests immediately above the upper horizontal
incision and apparently indicates that some animal, possibly a bird,
stood upon the human head. The fragment, however, is not sufficiently
large to settle these points. Two of the other fragments are apparently
intended to represent the heads of dogs. The eyes are indicated by the
common circle and dot design; while the nostrils in one are represented by
drilled dots. The shape of the heads is brought out by the carving of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
edge of the object. The fragments are broken off at the neck, and the
lower side of each shows the finished surface of the back of the object. The
remaining fragments show little or nothing. The animal heads and the
feet and hands suggest the possibility that in some cases animal forms were
combined in such figures, as on the Northwest Coast, although the general
style of art of the object is like neither Haida nor Kwakiutl work, but more
like the carvings of Puget Sound and the lower Columbia River. The fact
that the carving of this face is more in relief helps to explain the intent of
the author of the Tampico specimen.</p>

<p>The other specimen (50-3110 a, b, c) is a quill-flattener, made of antler
(<a href="#f122">Fig. 122</a>). It was obtained by Dr. Clark Wissler from the Dakota at Pine
Ridge, South Dakota, who also made reference to other objects of the same
sort among the tribe. Porcupine quills were flattened on it with the thumb
nail until after it had been broken, when the lower or pointed end had been
used as a brush in applying color to form designs on various articles made
of buckskin. This end is stained a deep red and the point is much worn.
The object, in general, resembles in shape and size the specimen from
Tampico. Its sides are somewhat thinner and sharper. The slight indications
of hair or headdress, the deeply cut eyes and mouth in the concave
side, the holes or ears at the sides of the head, and the method <a href="#TN">of</a> indicating
the arms by slits, setting them off, from the body, are all details which
emphasize this general resemblance. The technical work is about as good
as that of the Tampico specimen, but the art work is inferior. One edge
of the convex or outer surface of the bone has twenty-five notches, and in
each tooth left between them, as well as above the top one, is a small drilled
dot. Some of the notches on the other side are broken away with the arm,
which is missing. On the same surface are twenty-six horizontal incisions,
which were interpreted as year counts. The general shape of the body and
the rows of dots are similar to those of the figure pecked on the cliff at Sentinal
Bluffs (<a href="#XI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span>, Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>The Tampico specimen may have developed from a quill-flattener, which
implement was probably of common and characteristic use among Indian
mothers, not only of the Plains but also as far west as Tampico. If the
result of such a development, it had probably lost its domestic use and
become entirely symbolic.</p>

<p>Mr. Teit has heard the Thompson Indians speak of figures carved by
some men in their spare time, and valued highly as curiosities and works of
art. They had no practical value, and were generally used as ornaments
inside the house. They were in wood, bark, stone and antler, more generally
in the last three, and usually represented the human figure. Although the
Indians aver that they were sometimes very elaborately and truthfully carved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
it is impossible to say, in the absence of a good specimen from the Thompson
Indians whether there was any resemblance in style to that of this figure.
The Thompson sometimes, placed such figures on the tops of houses, but the
great majority were shown inside the houses. The Indian who made the
one illustrated<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> told Mr. Teit that he had seen some of larger size which
had taken a carver's spare time for many months.</p>

<p>The headdress seems to be a so-called war-bonnet, and would indicate
that the figure was that of an important personage; perhaps a suggestion of
what had been hoped for the child's position in the tribe or after death.
The arms, body, legs, and feet are apparently bare and ornamented with
ceremonial paintings, while about the waist is an apron. The whole object
seems of a rather high order of art to be a mere child's doll, and it would
seem more plausible to consider it as an emblematical figure. The general
style of art and costume indicated show little or no resemblance to those of
the Northwest Coast, but a strong relationship to those of the Plains.</p>

<p>There are some incised lines on the pipe shown in <a href="#f127">Fig. 127</a>. Those on
the pipe shown in <a href="#f104">Fig. 104</a> are described on <a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a>. In the Nez Perce
region, according to Spinden, incised designs, some of them of a pictographic
character and probably modern are found on pipes, and designs of
ladder shape are found on a flat plummet-shaped bone object.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p><a id="C69" name="C69"></a><i>Notches.</i> The notch in the base of the spatulate object made of bone
shown in <a href="#f58">Fig. 58</a> and the two notches in each side of the base may be for
practical purposes but were probably intended to be artistic, while the six
notches in the edge of the pendant made of slate shown in <a href="#f81">Fig. 81</a> probably
also have been intended for decoration or even to make the object represent
something although possibly the representation may be rather conventional.</p>

<p>In the Nez Perce region to the east,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> a notched stone has been found near
Asotin and notches occur as decorations on objects found in the Thompson
River region to the north, but, of this type, they are rare if not absent among
archaeological finds on the coast to the west from Fort Rupert on northern
Vancouver Island to Tacoma.</p>

<p><a id="C70" name="C70"></a><i>Circle and Dot Designs.</i> The circle and dot design is commonly found
in this region. It may be seen on the top of the pestle shown in <a href="#f30">Fig. 30</a>.
There is one of these designs in the tip and eleven about equi-distant in a row
around the edge of the knob. In the Nez Perce region to the east<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> the
design is found on bone gambling pieces. Further east, this design is also
found. This motive may be seen around the top of the bowl on a pipe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>(50-4867a, b) from the Gros Ventre Indians of Montana collected by Dr.
Clark Wissler, which, however, is considered to be recent. To the west,
it is not found among ancient things on the coast but among recent objects
it may be seen on certain bone gambling cylinders and on beaver teeth used
for dice. The design is common in the Thompson River region<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and the
Lillooet Valley between there and the coast.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> It is perhaps even more
frequently seen on the modern things among the Thompson River Indians<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
who often visit the Okanogan country.</p>

<p>The pipe shown in <a href="#f104">Fig. 104</a> was secured from an Indian who is known to
have frequently visited the Okanogan area so that if he did not bring the
pipe from there, he may at least have gotten the idea for this style of decoration
there. This suggests an explanation for the occurrence of the circle
and dot design on what are apparently older specimens from the Yakima
country. On the lower end of this specimen is a design made up of a zigzag
line based upon an incision running around where the stem meets the bowl.
The five triangles thus formed are nearly equilateral and there is a circle
and dot design in each. Other circles and dots are arranged in seven
equi-distant longitudinal pairs about the middle of the bowl. In addition,
parallel to these, and between two of the pairs, there is a double-headed
figure each end of which resembles the form of a crude fleur-de-lis. All of
the incisions on this pipe are colored with red paint. The circle and dot
design may be seen on the limestone pipe shown in <a href="#f106">Fig. 106</a>. There is one
circle and dot on the tip of the base, encircling this is a row of eight of them
and outside of this still another circle of nine. Around the opening for the
stem is a circle made up of eight, around the mouth of the bowl are ten and
between the circle around the bowl and the one around the stem are three
of the circles and dots. A typical circle and dot decoration is shown in <a href="#f120">Fig.
120</a> of what, as stated on <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>, may possibly have been used as a whetstone.
The object is made of slate and the top is broken off. It is 142 mm. long,
18 mm. wide and 6 mm. thick. The lower end and side edges are rounded.
On the reverse, the design is similar except that it is continued upward by
three circles and dots arranged in the same order as the uppermost three on
the obverse and that there are several slightly incised marks on it, one of
which, of X form, makes a tangent and a cord with the next to the lower
circle and dot. All the circles and dots are filled with red paint. There
are twelve incisions, possibly tally marks, on one side edge near the point.
The original is in the collection of Mr. Janeck.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>The symmetrical arrangement of the perforations and the pits on both
sides of the object shown in <a href="#f77">Fig. 77</a> was no doubt due to artistic motives.</p>

<p><a id="C71" name="C71"></a><i>Pecked Grooves.</i> Some designs were made by pecking grooves in stone.
Part of these, those forming petroglyphs, have been mentioned on <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a> and
are shown in <a href="#XI">Plates <span class="smcap lowercase">XI-XIII</span></a>. The upper portion of the marking on the
grooved stone shown in <a href="#f14">Fig. 14</a> is made in this way. It may represent a
feather headdress, such as is mentioned on <a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a> and such as is so common
in the pictographs as well as in the petroglyphs. The design on the lower
part of the same object was formed in the same way and on the obverse of
the net sinker shown in <a href="#f15">Fig. 15</a> are pecked grooves forming three concentric
semi-circles on each side of the groove and nearly parallel with the edges of
the object. Taken together, they give the suggestion of a spiral. There
are three pecked grooves encircling the stone mortar shown in <a href="#f20">Fig. 20</a> and two
around the head of the pestle shown in <a href="#f25">Fig. 25</a>. On each side of the lower
part of the pestle shown in <a href="#f31">Fig. 31</a> is a longitudinal design made up of four
parallel zigzag pecked grooves. The two pecked grooves at right angles to
each other on the specimen shown in <a href="#f60">Fig. 60</a> while they are probably made for
use may have been interpreted as decorative or artistic. This may also be
said of the three pecked grooves at right angles to each other on the club-head
shown in <a href="#f61">Fig. 61</a>, and it seems likely that the eight pecked pits made
in the middle of the spaces between these grooves and possibly even the two
pits at either pole of the object were intended to embellish it. Pecking was
also the process employed in forming the sculpture shown in <a href="#f125">Fig. 125</a>. The
four pyramidal or dome-shaped nipples on the top of the knob of a pestle
found at Five Mile Rapids mentioned on <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a> were probably made by pecking,
followed by polishing and they may have served a ceremonial as well
as a decorative purpose.</p>

<p><a id="C72" name="C72"></a><i>Animal and Human Forms.</i> There are a number of sculptures that
apparently were intended to represent heads of animals, whole animals and
human forms. The top of the pestle shown in <a href="#f31">Fig. 31</a> is sculptured to
represent what is apparently an animal head. The top of the one shown
in <a href="#f33">Fig. 33</a> has three nipples one of which is longer than the others. This
sculpture also seems to represent an animal head, the ears being indicated
by the short nipples and the nose by the long one. The top of the pestle
shown in <a href="#f34">Fig. 34</a> apparently represents an animal head, the mouth being
indicated by the groove, each eye by a pit and there are four incisions across
the top or back of the head. A sculptured animal head, with wide open
mouth, pits for eyes, and projections for ears on what may be a pestle top,
has been found in the Nez Perce region to the east<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and pestles with heads

are found in the Thompson River area to the north.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The knob shown
in <a href="#f35">Fig. 35</a> (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>) is interpreted as representing a snake's head. The
heart-shaped knob on the top of the club shown in <a href="#f68">Fig. 68</a> resembles the
form of an animal head and stands at an angle of about 45° to the axis of the club. Two of the incised circles
probably represent the eyes. The top of the handle of a digging stick made of horn of the Rocky Mountain
sheep, shown in <a href="#f126">Fig. 126</a> is sculptured to represent an
animal head. It was obtained from an Indian woman living near Union Gap below Old Yakima.</p>

<p><a href="#f124">Fig. 124</a> illustrates a fragment of sculpture from
Pasco. It is hoof-shaped and is here reproduced from
a sketch of the original in the collection of Mr. Owen.
The sculptured animal form made of lava shown in <a href="#f125">Fig.
125</a> which was mentioned on <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>, bears a mortar or
dish in its back. It is a good example of an art form which has been
specialized so that it may be used or at least so that the useful part is less
prominent than the animal figure. It has been sculptured by pecking.
The raised eyes are almond-shaped rather than elliptical, and the ears are
indicated by raised places on the transverse ridge at the top of the head.
The mid-rib or dewlap under the chin is about 6 mm. wide and of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>three transverse grooves in this, only the upper one is deep. The tail is
slightly under cut. The grooves are all more or less colored with vermilion,
apparently a mineral paint and consequently sufficiently lasting so that we
need not consider even the painting as necessarily modern. The general
form and especially the four elephantine legs remind
us of a somewhat similar animal form with a dish
in its back found in a shell heap in the delta of the
Fraser River<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> and the animal form with the dish in

illustrates the modern type of carving in soft, easily cut stone, as well as the style of white metal inlaying
employed here during recent years. In this case, the inlaying is nearly bilaterally symmetrical as
may be seen by comparing <a href="#f128">Fig. 128a</a> with the outlines
in <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>. The carving is not symmetrical, the human form holding a fish-like form appearing
on one side only, while the rear figure evidently represents a turtle which animal is found in the valley.
The other two figures are not easily identified but the forward one perhaps represents a dog, the white
metal inlay on it possibly representing a harness, but as likely was merely for decoration. The figure
on the base of the pipe might represent a lizard or any quadruped with a long tail. This form and the
way it is represented as clinging to the cylindrical part of the pipe at least remind us of similar forms
seen on totem poles in the region from Puget Sound
to Victoria.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The technique is rather crude and the style of art does not
closely resemble that of the coast, but reminds us of certain sculptures
found on pipes and on the carved wooden stems of pipes in the Plains
where this particular shape of pipe is much more common than here.</p>

<p>In <a href="#f105">Fig. 105</a> is illustrated a fragment of a sculptured tubular pipe made
from steatite by cutting or scratching and drilling the soft material rather
than by pecking. It was apparently intended to represent an anthropoid
form. The mouth is indicated by an incision, the other features of the head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>are more difficult to determine, but both the arm and the leg stand out in
high relief. As previously suggested on <a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>, this style of art slightly
resembles that found in the region from the Lillooet Valley to the Lower
Willamette and as far east at least as The Dalles.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> It is possible that some

Lillooet Valley on the east and the Yakima region on the north, may be
somewhat related to the style of art of this fragmentary pipe. The human
form shown in <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> has been discussed on <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a> as it is incised rather
than carved in the round. Clark mentions a "malet of stone curiously
carved,"<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> which he says was used

artistic, while the fact that the pipe shown in <a href="#f113">Fig. 113</a> somewhat
represents a tomahawk or hatchet suggests that it may have been

is clearly of the art of the northwest coast. It must have been brought to
this region from as far at least, as the Kwakiutl and Haida region, and may
be the work of an artist from that part of the coast, on Vancouver Island,
north of Comox. Although in a fragmentary condition, this sculpture exhibits
an excellent technique of its style of art. Astride of the stem is a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>
human figure with the left hand to the chest, and the right one resting on
the right knee. The head is missing, the chest muscular. The other end
of the pipe apparently represents the thunder bird. The head and most
of the figure are bilaterally symmetrical. The beak is cut off in such a
manner as to form a flat surface at the tip. The feathers of the rear portion
of the left wing extend in a different direction from those on the tip, while
those of the right wing are parallel with those on the rear part of the left
wing. The lower side or tail of this bird figure is broken off, but it probably
extended to the broken place shown at the neck of the human face on the
base of the pipe. In it, may be seen a groove, the half of a longitudinal
perforation which does not connect with the pipe bowl. The carving on the
right side of the pipe bowl, the top of which is broken away, is practically
the same as that on the left, while the base is carved to represent a human
head.</p>

<h2><a id="C74" name="C74"></a><span class="smcap">Method of Burial.</span></h2>

<p>In ancient times, there were three principal methods of disposing of the
dead: in graves in domes of volcanic ash, in rock-slide graves, and in cremation
circles. In all of these they were covered with stones.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Detailed descriptions
of the graves explored by us, are given in the appendix. There
are also burials covered with pebbles, some of which may be old; and recent
graves (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>), where the bodies were apparently buried at length with the
feet to the east, and both head and foot marked by a stake, the one at the
head being the larger. Simple graves in the level ground known to be old
were not found. Gibbs saw bodies wrapped in blankets and tied upright
to tree trunks at some distance above the ground near the mouth of the
Okanogan River.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p><a id="C75" name="C75"></a><i>Burials in Domes of Volcanic Ash.</i> In this arid region are stretches of
country locally known as 'scab land,' on which are occasionally groups of
low dome-shaped knolls from about fifty to one hundred feet in diameter,
by three to six feet in height.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> These knolls consist of fine volcanic ash,
and apparently have been left by the wind because held in place by roots of
sage brush and other vegetation. This ashy material has been swept
from the intervening surface leaving the 'scab land' paved with fragments
of basalt imbedded in a hard soil. The prehistoric Indians of this region,
have used many of these knolls, each as a site for a single grave <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>(<a href="#IX">Fig. 2,
Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span></a>).<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> These graves, which are located in the tops of the knolls, are
usually marked by large river pebbles, or, in some cases, by fragments of
basalt that appear as a circular pavement projecting slightly above the surface
of the soil. None of them are known to be recent. On the other hand,
there is no positive evidence of their great antiquity. In these we sometimes
find a box or cyst. This box (<a href="#X">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span></a>) was formed of thin slabs of basaltic
rock some placed on edge and large flat slabs covering the cyst so formed.
Above this, as was usually the case, above the skeletons in this kind of
grave, the space was filled with irregular rocks or pebbles. The rocks and
cyst were entirely different from those of the cairns of the coast of Washington
and British Columbia.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The skeletons were found flexed, on the side.
In the graves, artifacts such as dentalium shells were deposited at the time
of burial.</p>

<p>The Kalapuya of the Willamette Valley to the southwest, buried their
dead in the earth. One writer described the process as follows:&mdash;"When
the grave was dug they placed slabs on the bottom and sides, and when they
had lowered the wrapped body down, placed another over, resting on the
side ones, and filled in the earth."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The account does not seem to indicate
whether these slabs were of wood or stone, but in either case there is a certain
similarity to the graves with the stone cyst found near Tampico.</p>

<p>A grave which may be of this type, found about two and one half miles
south of Fort Simcoe was reported to me by Mrs. Lynch who furnished the
following information about it. It was on a low ridge with the usual cairn
of rocks about three feet high covering it. This cairn was made up of two
distinct layers of rocks, both lying above the contents of the grave which
included the skeleton of an adult man estimated to be at least six feet tall
and that of a child about six to eight years of age, according to identifications
made by the physician of the United States Indian service stationed at Fort
Simcoe. The man's skull which was well preserved though brittle, was
found four feet below the ground or approximately seven feet below the top
of the cairn and on the eastern side of the grave. The pelvis of the child
was completely decayed, and few of the bones were intact except the maxilla
which was found in the western part of the grave between the patellæ of the
man. Near them were found four "links" [beads] of a copper necklace.
The maxilla was deeply copper-stained. The steatite ornament shown in
<a href="#f119">Fig. 119</a> was found on the man's manubrium.</p>

<p><a id="C76" name="C76"></a><i>Rock-slide Graves.</i> The rock-slides on the hill and canon sides as in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>region to the north had frequently been used as burial places. The graves
are found from top to bottom. Some of them seem very old. Others were
proven to be recent by the character of the objects found in them. The
skeletons were in or on the ground and the rocks of the slide had been piled
or caused to slide over them (<a href="#VIII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span></a>).<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The skeleton was buried
from one to five, six or even ten feet deep. In some cases, the rocks seemed
to have sunk as the body decayed, in others they formed a pile as if placed
there to mark the grave. Some graves were marked with sticks (<a href="#VI">Fig. 3,
Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span></a>). In others, probably always the older graves, sticks were not
seen having doubtless decayed. One of the graves found rifled 75 feet
above the little flat at the edge of the north side of the Naches River about a
mile and a half above its mouth, seemed to lie walled up with rocks like a
well and slabs of a broken canoe, part of which had been thrown out surrounded
a few of the disturbed bones. The skeletons were always in a
flexed position (<a href="#VIII">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span></a>) and objects were found to have been
placed in some of these graves.</p>

<p>Spinden states that cemeteries are readily located by the heaps of "river-worn
or rock-slide boulders" piled over the graves in the Nez Perce country.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
They are usually on the first bench above the river bottom and are found
near the traditional village sites, from which they can be seen. The more
common method of disposing of the dead there, was by burial in the ground,
especially on stony hillsides, and covering the graves with stones to keep off
the wild animals. This seems to have been the prevailing method throughout
the whole Columbia region of which this is a part.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Rock-slide graves
were sometimes made in basaltic cliffs in the Nez Perce region. One of
these is known to have been used in recent times from the presence of a
Lewis and Clark medal,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and graves marked by pieces of upright cedar and
covered by large piles of stone are reported by Spinden on the east bank of
the Snake River, beside the mouth of the Grande Ronde.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Indian graves filled up with stones are numerous in the vicinity of the
several remains (pp. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>, <a href="#Page_54">54</a> and <a href="#Page_82">82</a>) near Mr. Turner's home, according
to Mr. J. S. Cotton. Mr. Turner told him that all the graves that had been
excavated contained bones in a greatly decayed condition, which suggested
to him that they were very old. These graves, like the other remains of the
vicinity previously mentioned, have been in the same condition since about
1874.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The terraces mentioned on <a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a> (<a href="#VII">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">Vii</span></a>)<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> may have been
made to facilitate reaching rock-slide graves in the same slide; while the
pits which were found in the slides (<a href="#VII">Fig. 2, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span></a>)<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> walled up on the
outer sides like balconies, with the rocks that apparently came both from
the pits and the disturbed slide above them, have been considered as rifled
graves or graves from which the burials had been removed (<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>).</p>

<p>The following quotation may refer to rock-slide pits:<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> "In the eastern
part of Marion County, Oregon, there stands an isolated and most strikingly
regular and beautiful butte some three hundred feet in height and covering
nearly a section of land. It was fringed about its base, at the time of which
I write, with fir groves, but its sides and well rounded and spacious top were
devoid of timber, except a few old and spreading oaks, and perhaps a half
dozen gigantic firs, whose weighty limbs were drooping with age. A meridian
section line passes over the middle of this butte, and four sections
corner near its top. While running this line and establishing these corners
in 1851, I observed many semi-circular walls of stone, each enclosing space
enough for a comfortable seat, and as high as one's shoulders when in a
sitting posture, upon cross-sticks as high as the knee ... the older white
residents said the Indians made them, but for what purpose they could not
say. I became a witness to the use, and was particularly impressed with the
fitness for what I saw. Indians from the North and South traveling that
way generally camped upon the banks of the Abiqua Creek, a rapid stream
of pure, cold water, just issued from the mountains upon the plain. The
butte was near, and this they ascended and, taking seats within the stone
sanctuaries, communed in silence with the Great Spirit. Bowing the head
upon the hands and resting them upon the knees for a few moments, then
sitting erect and gazing to the west over the enchanting valley interspersed
with meadow, grove and stream." The author states that the place is now
called Mount Angel, is surmounted by a Roman Catholic cathedral and that
the Indians called this butte Tap-a-lam-a-ho, signifying Mount of Communion;
and the plain to the west Chek-ta, meaning beautiful or enchanting.</p>

<p>Possibly the burials in the domes of volcanic ash and those in the rock-slides
are practically the results of a common motive by the same people in
the same time and the differences may be due simply to the difference in the
character of the near by topography and the relative convenience of securing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>the material to cover the graves. This idea is strengthened by information
given me by Mr. W. H. Hindshaw who stated that from sixteen to thirty
miles above the mouth of the Snake River where it cuts through canons
there are rock burial heaps immediately above flood level and burials in the
flood sand below, both of which he found to contain human bones and
implements. He also stated that graves are found on the bluff overlooking
the river. One was curbed with the remains of a cedar canoe. The grave
had a bottom of plank and a cover over the body&mdash;that of a small child&mdash;which
was wrapped in a fur, apparently a beaver skin. There were a number
of beads and brass buttons and a large fragment of the shell of the
<i>Schizothoerus nuttallii</i> which must have come from the coast.</p>

<p><a id="C77" name="C77"></a><i>Cremation Circles.</i> Rings of stones (<a href="#IX">Fig. 1, Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span></a>)<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> were also seen
and on excavation within them cremated human remains were found usually
several in each circle. In some cases the ring was irregular and in others
assumed the form of a rectangle. None of them are known to be recent.
In such places, dentalium shells, flat shell beads, and shell ornaments were
usually seen. Mr. Teit says that rings of stones were also put on top of
graves in the Thompson River region. Along the Columbia, below the
mouth of the Snake River, vaults or burial houses like those found among
the Upper Chinook were used.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> A somewhat similar method was observed
even among the Nez Perce.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> This suggests that the cremation circles here
described, may be the caved-in remains of earth-covered burial lodges built
somewhat on the plan of the semi-subterranean winter houses.</p>

<p><a id="C78" name="C78"></a><i>Position of the Body.</i> In all the old graves the skeletons were flexed and
usually on the side (<a href="#VIII">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span>, Fig. 2</a>).<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The graves where the body was
buried at length with the feet to the east were doubtless recent and probably
placed that way due to the teachings of Christians. In the Nez Perce region
to the east, the body was placed in a variety of positions, either flexed or
at length<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> and sometimes upon the side. Considering the difference between
the costume and objects used by the men and those by the women, in the
Nez Perce region to the east,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> it would seem that the contents of the graves in
this near by region may be used to check the determination of the sex of
the skeletons.</p>

<p><a id="C79" name="C79"></a><i>Property with the Dead.</i> Objects are usually found with the remains of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>the dead in all classes of old burials but some of the graves contained nothing;
others very little. There was apparently no radical difference in the character
of the material in the graves in volcanic domes and those in the rock-slides;
but the more modern rock-slide graves seemed, on the whole, to contain a
greater number of objects than the older graves or the graves in domes.
On the coast, objects are found with recent burials, but rarely in ancient
graves. The cremation circles often contained dentalium shells and bits of
shell objects but little else. In the Nez Perce region to the east a considerable
amount of property, ornaments and utensils is found buried with the dead.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p><a id="C80" name="C80"></a><i>Horse Sacrifices.</i> We discovered no graves containing horse bones or
over which a skeleton of a horse was found, although it will be remembered
that such were found in the Nez Perce region east of here.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> There, the
killing of horses over the graves of their owners became the usual practice
when horses were plentiful. Sometimes a horse was buried over the body.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
In this region, however, we found no evidences of the horse in connection
with the graves other than the presence of an old Spanish bit in one of the
more recent burials.</p>

<p><a id="C81" name="C81"></a><i>Diseases.</i> Out of about seventeen complete skeletons and six skulls
secured in this region by our party those of two children (99-4323, 99-4326)
and two adults, one of which was apparently a female (99-4336), exhibited
anchylosis of some of the vertebrae. The left ankle bones of the other
skeleton (99-4327) showed anchylosis with the tibia and one of the ribs
was abnormal. The skeleton of a young child (99-4329) with persistent
frontal suture, an example of retarded development was also found.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<h2><a id="C82" name="C82"></a><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></h2>

<p>The connection, nay partial identity, of this culture with that of the
Thompson River region in the southern interior of British Columbia is supported
by considerable evidence. Small heaps of fresh-water clam shells
are found in both regions. The preponderance of chipped points over those
ground out of stone, bone and antler; the presence of digging stick handles;
pestles with flaring bodies and no striking heads, others with tops in the form
of animal heads; celts; the sites of cache pits, of circular summer lodges
marked by rings of stones; and of semi-subterranean houses with stones on
the encircling ridge; pairs of arrow-shaft smoothers, and bone tubes, were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>all found to be common to both regions. The simple pipe bowl found here,
although with one exception not found among archaeological objects in the
Thompson area is commonly used by the present Indians there. Tubular
pipes, modern copper tubes or beads, incised designs consisting of a circle
with a dot in it and engraved dentalium shells, each of a particular kind, besides
pictographs in red, rock-slide sepulchres, modern graves walled up
with parts of canoes, the marking of recent graves with sticks, and the custom
of burying artifacts with the dead were also found to be common to both
areas. Perforated slate tablets of gorget-form are unknown in both regions.
Circles of stones which mark places where cremated human remains were
found in this region sometimes indicate graves in the Thompson River
region.</p>

<p>Frazer<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> mentions meeting Yakima Indians in the Lillooet Valley which
shows that they travelled even beyond the Thompson River country and
readily accounts for the dissemination of cultural elements.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many differences in culture are observable. Thus
objects made of nephrite and mica which occur, the former being common
in the Thompson River valley, were not found in the Yakima area. Quarries
and terraced rock-slides such as were seen here are not known to us in
the Thompson River region. The bone of the whale occasionally found in
the Thompson River country is lacking in Yakima collections. That glassy
basalt was not the chief material for chipped implements, as it was in the
Thompson River region, is probably due to the scarcity of this material
and its use is perhaps as rare in the Yakima valley as on the coast. Chipped
implements were made of a greater variety of stone than in the interior of
British Columbia, and a greater proportion were of the more beautifully
colored materials. No harpoon points made of a unio (?) shell, such as
the object found in the Thompson River region or other objects made of
such a shell, were seen. Notched sinkers and large grooved sinkers were
more commonly found than in the Thompson Valley, while sap scrapers
which were common there, were not found in the Yakima district. A great
number of pestles made from short cylindrical pebbles, forming a type
rather rare in the Thompson River region; many long pestles, of which
only four or five have been found in interior British Columbia; and one
with a zigzag design not represented among the finds from that region,
were found in the Yakima area. Saucer-shaped depressions marking
summer lodge sites were not noted by the writer. Clubs made of stone
were more numerous and all are of a different type. Clubs or other objects
made of the bone of the whale or drilled pendants either circular or
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>elongated were not found. Petroglyphs, pictographs in white, and representations
of feather headdresses were not found among the archaeological
objects in the Thompson region. Graves in knolls, some with a cyst made
of thin slabs of stones constitute another distinct trait of the Yakima area.</p>

<p>There is relatively less evidence of contact with the prehistoric people of
Puget Sound and the Pacific coast of Washington, and of southern British
Columbia. Several kinds of sea shells, including dentalium, haliotis and
pectunculus, which must have come from the coast, were found in the Yakima
Valley. Small points chipped from beautiful material found in this region
were occasionally seen on the coast, more particularly south of Puget
Sound. Glassy basalt was used here perhaps about as much as on the coast.
Net sinkers are also about as common here as on the coast from Gray's Harbor
southward. The pestles found in the vicinity of Vancouver Island are
similar to some of the short pestles found in the Yakima region. Short tubular
pipes are found on the coast in the vicinity of the Saanich Peninsula and
the Lower Frazer. The pipe previously described as clearly representative
of the art of the Northwest coast must have been brought from there or
made by a coast artist, not by one merely <a href="#TN">familiar</a> with the art of the coast.
A portion of the material indicative of coast culture that was found in the
Yakima Valley may have come up the Cowlitz and down the Toppenish
River.</p>

<p>The similarities mentioned are, however, outweighed by marked differences.
Large shell heaps&mdash;the chief feature of Coastal archaeology&mdash;have
not been found in the Yakima area, while quarries are unknown to us
on the coast. Objects made of nephrite and whale's bone are lacking in the
Yakima Valley. A very great number of points rubbed out of slate and bone
are found on the coast, but none rubbed out of slate and only a few rubbed
out of bone have been found on Yakima sites. Net sinkers are much more
common than on the coast, where they are plentiful only from Gray's Harbor
southward and in the Lower Columbia Valley. Long pestles with the
tops carved to represent animal heads are distinctive of the Yakima area,
while cylindrical pebbles used as pestles but slightly changed from the natural
form, which are quite common in the Yakima Valley, are rarely found
in the Coast country. One style of club made of stone commonly found in
this vicinity has not been seen anywhere on the coast, although some clubs
made of stone are like specimens from that region. Perforated slate tablets
like Coastal gorgets are unknown to us from the Yakima area. Cairns
common on the coast are not found in the Yakima country, while the reverse
holds true of rock-slide burials. Graves in knolls are unknown on the Pacific,
and artifacts are often found in the Yakima graves but they seldom, if
ever, occur with ancient burials on the coast.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Much of the material from the Yakima region resembles that which I
have seen from the general area including the Columbia Valley between Umatilla
and The Dalles, and possibly extending further down the valley.
There seems to be a greater similarity of the art products of the Yakima to
those of the Thompson River region than to those of the Columbia Valley
below the mouth of the Snake, so far as we understand the latter region at
this time, and this according to Lewis<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> is certainly not contrary to the belief
in an earlier occupancy of this region by the Salish. The culture here
resembles that of the Nez Perce region to the east in that a considerable
variety of material was used for chipped implements.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>Inter-tribal trade may have been a factor in the production of some observed
similarities. It was seen that pipes of three types, one of which is
found as far east as the Dakota, another as far north as the Thompson River
country, and a third as far west as the Queen Charlotte Islands are all found
in this region. It is clear that the ancient people from the Yakima region
had extensive communications not only with the region southward as far as
The Dalles, but also northward, as far as the more distant Thompson River
tribes. If the products of the sea found in this region came up the Columbia,
as may be inferred from Lewis,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> it is a good illustration of how trade as
a rule, follows the line of least physical resistance; although the migrations
of the tribes do not always follow such lines because the lines of trade as a
rule are thickly populated by people who resist the migration of their neighbors.
Lewis<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> states that from the coast inward there was only one trade
route of importance in the Washington-Oregon-Idaho region and this led up
the Columbia River to The Dalles where was found the greatest trade center
in the whole region and whither the tribes were wont to come from the north
and south as well as from the east.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Klamath,<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Cayuse, Nez Perce, Walla
Walla and other Sahaptin and probably Salish tribes were all in the habit of
going there to traffic. He also states that further east, the Sahaptin in their
turn, traded with the Shoshone from whom they obtained buffalo robes and
meat. The center for this trade at least in later times was the Grande Ronde
in eastern Oregon;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> but this later center probably came into being after the
advent of the horse. The Okanogan are known to have crossed the mountains
to Puget Sound to trade wild hemp for sea shells especially dentalia as well as
for other small objects.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The Yakima also in later times crossed the moun<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>tains
and traded with Puget Sound tribes according to Gibbs,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> but if this
trade were carried on in earlier times its effect in the Yakima Valley seems to
have been slight as indicated by the few dentalium shells, the shell pendants
shown in Figs. <a href="#f87">87</a>-<a href="#f94">94</a> and the pipe of coast art, shown in <a href="#f127">Fig. 127</a>. It is possible
that this trade with the coast became customary only after the horse
was introduced. There was a considerable amount of trade between the Yakima
and the Thompson River and other tribes of British Columbia which
was carried on chiefly through the Okanogan.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Lewis<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> states that the Walla
Walla who lived to the south of the Yakima at least in later times visited as
far north as the Thompson River region, and that certain Sahaptin tribes
seem to have moved northward and westward and forced back the Salish
tribes which at the time of Lewis and Clark's visit were on the north bank of
the Columbia and on its tributaries.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> These tribes were particularly the
Klickitat and the Yakima, an assumption which Lewis states is supported by
the definite assertions of the natives themselves. A number of old men positively
assured Dr. Suckley that they had pushed their way into the country
formerly occupied by the Salish.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> The Klickitat, although living in a well
wooded region on the southern slopes of Mt. Adams and Mt. St. Helens are
thought to have been driven by the Cayuse from their earlier home which
was further east and south. Later, they went further west into the Cowlitz
Valley.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> This may account for the circular pit surrounded by an embankment
which I saw near Rochester in Thurston County and interpreted as the
remains of a semi-subterranean winter house site. Lewis also states that the
Yakima probably lived on the Columbia near the mouth of the river which
now bears their name, and are in fact so located by Cox who places them on
the north and east side of the Columbia. The pressure of neighboring tribes
caused by the coming of the white race no doubt facilitated the adoption of
new cultural details.</p>

<p>As late as 1854, the Palus, a tribe living further east on the Paloose River
regarded themselves as a portion of the Yakima and the head chief of the
Yakima as their chief.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The general similarity of the Walla Walla language
to that of the Klickitat and Yakima rather than to that of the Nez Perce is
mentioned by Lewis.</p>

<p>Cultural elements, especially those associated with the horse and with
the new mode of life which it made possible, probably came from the region
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>to the southeast, and show a great similarity to the Plains type of culture.
How much the Plains culture had influenced the Plateau type before the introduction
of the horse, is a question.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> On the Columbia River, near the
mouth of the Yakima, were numerous Indians who were visited by Clark in
1805, but he says that while he saw a few horses, the Indians appeared to
make but little use of them. If these were the Yakima Indians there must
have been quite a change in their manner of living in the next few years.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
This agrees very well with the time of the introduction of the horse among
the Lower Thompson Indians towards the close of the eighteenth century,
according to Teit.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> All this would tend to show that the horse, while common
in the Yakima country, about that time, had not yet affected the earlier
customs of the natives.</p>

<p>The early culture throughout the great area of which this is a part,
according to Lewis, was of a very simple and undeveloped character, which
probably accounts for the rapidity with which eastern types were assimilated
when once introduced.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Summing up: the prehistoric culture of the Yakima area resembled that
of its recent inhabitants, as it will be remembered was the case in the Thompson
River region, the Lower Fraser Valley and the Puget Sound country
including the coast from Comox on Vancouver Island to Olympia. As a
typical plateau culture, being affiliated with the neighboring cultures to the
north, east and south, it presented a sharp contrast to both the present and
past cultures of the coast to the west. Compared with other branches of the
Plateau culture area it must be considered inferior in complexity to its northern
neighbor of the southern interior of British Columbia and also to the adjacent
branch near The Dalles to the south. While each of these divisions
has been influenced by the others more especially in the past, differentiations
due to environment or specific historical conditions lead to local variations
without obscuring an essential unity of cultural traits.</p>

<p>Grave No. 1. <a href="#VI">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span>, Fig. 3</a> (1910) from north of west of the grave before it was
disturbed (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>). This grave was about 50 feet up the gully
from No. 2, and was excavated by us May 18. It was marked by a
stick which was very dry but not yet fully decayed. It was located
in the rock-slide on the east slope of the gully, a steep ravine going
down from the south to a little flat southeast of the Yakima River.
This ravine is on the north side of the hill on the east of the Yakima
River at the mouth of the Naches River. The grave was about a
mile northeast of the mouth of the Naches River, and about 80 feet
above the Yakima. From the spot one can see out over the valley
of the Yakima. The grave was on a slight, bench, terrace, or place
that could be so interpreted. There were large pits and terraces in
the slide above this grave, like those shown in <a href="#VII">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span></a>. Indications
of very old charred cedar strips were found across the grave.
Charcoal was found among the rocks, and the grave was bounded
by a sort of circular balcony of rocks of the rock-slide and had a slight
flat or depression in the center. On top, the stones were large,
averaging the size of a man's head, some 30 pounds, some 100 pounds,
some the size of a man's fist. Below, covering the body, the rocks
were small and many were fine, being chipped small from the same
rock by fire. All except this burned rock were the common irregular
angular rock-slide material. In the bottom of the grave were found
adult human bones, partly charred black, the parts not so charred
were yellow. Numbers 202-8137 to 202-8152 were found in this
grave.</p>

<p>Grave No. 11. Rock-slide grave located on the north side of the Naches River, a
little over half a mile above its mouth. The place is about 600 feet
west southwest of grave No. 10 and 150 feet above the river. It was
6 feet by 4 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep. Apparently it had been
rifled as nothing was found in it except a skull and a few bones.</p>

<p>99-4319. Skull, a lower jaw, and a few broken bones which were scattered among
the rocks. The skull was found in the west southwest part of the
grave with the face down. The lower jaw was found in the southern
part of the grave about 1 foot higher up in the rocks.</p>

<p>Grave No. 12. Bluff pebble grave. We examined a ring of river boulders on the
twenty-acre farm of Mr. James McWhirter, a boy about fifteen years
old, twelve miles up the Naches River on the crest of the foothill
terrace north of the road, and overlooking the bottom along the
north side of the Naches River. This grave was about 150 feet high
above the river by about half a mile from it. At first it looked like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>little underground house site or a shallow cache pit. (Museum
negative, no. 44441, 1-2 for general locality.) James, who called
our attention to the pile of boulders, said that some one threw off
part in an abandoned attempt to dig the grave. We thought the
grave practically undisturbed and it proved to have been the least
disturbed of any we had found up to this point. The outside of the
ring was 10 feet east and west by 5 feet north and south. The inside
of the ring or the space surrounded was 6 feet east and west by 4 feet
north and south. Probably this grave was a boulder heap, the
aspect of a ring being given by the removal of the stones, i.e., this
central space may be where stones were thrown off. River boulders
were found from top to bottom. The boulders varied in weight from
about 7 to 30 pounds. Most of them were disk-shaped but some
were oval. Numbers 99-4320 and 202-8170, 1 were found in this
grave.</p>

<p>99-4320. An adult skeleton was found 4 feet deep with the head towards the west,
resting on its occiput. The skull which was broken, faced south by
east, with the mouth open. The knees were north; the body was on
its left side and flexed. Over the north side of the knees was an
elliptically-shaped piece of cedar burned on the upper side. It was
about 2 feet wide by 4 feet long. A few fragments of the skeleton of
a child were found in the grave. All the bones in the grave were
very soft and as the ends were broken off we discarded all but the
skull and a few of the bones of the child. Two shell disks (202-8170,1)
were found about 6 inches apart near the neck, one at the
south shoulder, and one at the south side of the skull of the adult.</p>

<p>Grave No. 13. Cremation circle, similar to several of the others on the terrace
northwest of the mouth of the Naches River. This consisted of a
ring of angular rocks among which were no river pebbles, resembling
a small underground house site, 8 feet in diameter outside, 6 feet in
diameter at the top of the rocks, 4-&frac12; feet in diameter inside, both east-west
and north-south. It is widest and built of largest stones
on the side towards the lower part of the terrace, suggesting that the
ring had slid down but the nearly level terrace would argue against
this idea. This grave was like a rock-slide grave, filled with soil,
but on a gently sloping terrace instead of a steep slide. Photograph
no. 44495, 5-8, from the south shows a telegraph pole to left and a
flume across the Yakima River to the right. See also graves No. 14
and 15. Child bones, found two feet deep in volcanic ash, were
decayed and discarded. The tibiae were about 2-&frac12; inches long.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Grave No. 14. This cremation circle was situated on the terrace about 100 feet
above the Naches River and about 250 yards north of the two bridges
near its mouth. <a href="#IX">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">IX</span>, Fig. 1</a> (photograph no. 44493, 5-6) shows
this from the east with telegraph poles beyond. The stone circle<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>
measured 6 feet north and south inside (16 outside) by 7 feet east and
west inside (14 outside). Our excavation here was 6 by 5 by 4 feet
deep. Fragments of charred human bones, and some that seemed
not to be charred, of six or seven individuals were found from about
1 foot deep down to 4 feet deep. Most of these were pieces of skulls,
but pieces of many other bones were found. The bones which were
most burned, were those found nearest the surface. Much charcoal
was seen. A layer of ashes about 6 inches in thickness was found in
the center. In the northwest part of the hole a skeleton was found
lying on the left side flexed, the face east, and the head north. This
may have been buried after the others. The bones were very much
decomposed and the skull was broken into small pieces. Numbers
202-8172 to 202-8174 were found in this grave.</p>

<p>202-8172. A shell ornament found on the east side of the skull.</p>

the east in photograph No. 44494, 5-7. It is 56 feet west of grave
No. 14 and further up the terrace. The outside circle of stones
measured 15 feet north and south by 15 feet east and west. The
next circle of stones measured 9 feet north and south by 9 feet east
and west. The space inside the stone circle measured 7 feet north
and south by 7 feet east and west. The depth varied from 2 feet
6 inches in the east and south parts to 4 feet in the north and west
parts below all of which was a pitching layer of basaltic rocks. The
three rings of stones surrounded a hollow. The inner row was about
12 inches lower than the outer ring. Several boulders were found in
the grave. Ashes and lava composed the grave soil. The whole
cremation circle seemed to have been the burned remains of a communal
or family depository for the dead, probably a hut like an underground
winter house walled around the edge of the roof with stones.
Two skeletons were found on the bottom, apparently not burned, but
much decayed. They were discarded. Numbers 202-8175 to 202-8182
were found in this grave.</p>

<p>202-8175. Charcoal was abundant but most of it was found about 14 inches deep.</p>

<p><a id="no25" name="no25"></a>Grave No. 25. Eglin stone grave located in a volcanic ash knoll left behind by wind
and surrounded by 'scab land' on the bottom land about 18 miles
up and west of North Yakima or nearly to Tampico, Yakima County,
and on the north side of the river road, but east of the north and
south branch road which is east of Mr. Sherman Eglin's place; about
600 feet north of the north branch of the Ahtanum river and about
15 feet above the water level. Over the grave was a stone heap of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161" name="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
angular basalt about 8 feet in diameter. At a depth of 3 feet, after
finding stones all the way down, was a cyst (Negative, nos. 44498,
5-11 and 44499, 5-12, reproduced in <a href="#X">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span></a>, from the same station
looking east), made up of slabs averaging 2 inches in maximum
thickness with thin sharp edges about 2 feet by 18 inches and
smaller. There were two such cover stones, some at the sides and
ends. Sometimes two or three such slabs were found parallel or
overlapping. There were no slabs or floor below the skeleton. This
grave resembled very much the stone graves of Ohio and Kentucky
except that the slabs were not of limestone and there was a pile of
rocks over the stone cyst. Numbers 99-4321, and 202-8191 to 202-8195
were found in this grave.</p>

<p>99-4321. In the cyst about on a level with the lower edges of the enclosing slabs
was the skeleton of a child about six years old with head west, face
north, and the knees flexed on the left side. The skull was slightly
deformed by occipital pressure (<a href="#X">Plate <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span></a>).</p>

<p>202-8191. Horizontally under the vertebrae was found an engraved slab of antler
in the form of a costumed human figure with the engraved surface
up (<a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a>).</p>

<p>202-8192. Dentalium shells were found under the body, from the neck to the pelvis.</p>

<p>202-8193. Ten engraved dentalium shells (<a href="#f117">Fig. 117</a>).</p>

<p>202-8194. A bit of bone.</p>

<p>202-8195. Charcoal found in this grave.</p>

<p>The grave (No. 25) and its contents seem to antedate the advent of the
white race in this region or at least show no European influence.</p>

<p>Grave No. 26. Rock-marked grave in a dome left by the wind near the pasture
gate on Mr. A. D. Eglin's place and about half a mile north of his
house near Tampico. A heap of somewhat angular wind abraded
rock some being smooth, (none being river pebbles or rock-slide
material) marked the grave and extended below the surface about
two feet. Then about 1 foot of earth intervened between them and
thin rocks found around the bones of a very young child. The skull
was in the northwest end of the grave and was disarticulated. The
depth was 4 feet, the length of the excavation 4 feet, and the width 3
feet. The skeleton was found with the head northwest and the pelvis
southeast. A grave with outward appearance resembling this except
that it had river pebbles among the stones of the pile is shown in <a href="#IX">Fig.

<p>Grave No. 30. Stone circle located on the crest of a western extension of the Saddle
Mountains on Mr. Bull's farm, east of Cherry Creek and about seven
miles south of Ellensburg. The place is east of the village site above-mentioned
which is on the bottom land along the west side of the
creek at this point. A circular ring of stones, 10 feet in diameter
marked the grave. Smaller stones and earth in the middle extended
3 feet 6 inches down to the skeleton. No objects were found except
a plentiful supply of charcoal.</p>

<p>99-4325. The bones of an adult human skeleton which appeared as if it had been
flexed were found very much out of anatomical order. It lay northeast
and southwest in the southeast part of the grave. There was a
large hole in the right frontal of the skull which lay facing the northwest.
The lower jaw was found on top of the skull with its angle
east. Fragments of the tibiae were blackened by fire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Grave No. 31. Rock-slide grave located in the rock-slide on the west side of the bluff,
a western extension of the Saddle Mountains, east of Cherry Creek<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>
and about half a mile southwest of Mr. Bull's house. One small
piece of decayed wood was found projecting above the rock-slide,
and it was the only indication of the grave, there being no cavity
over it. Among the rocks, four more posts were found, one at each
corner of the grave. These had evidently rotted off even with the
surface, having formerly, no doubt, extended above it. The depth
of the grave was from 2 to 3 feet, according to the slope of the hill.
Numbers 99-4326 and 202-8223 to 202-8228 were found in this grave.</p>

<p>99-4326. Skeleton of a child with anchylosed neck vertebrae. Some of the bones
were bleached. The bones were very much displaced, the skull
being found in the middle of the grave and some of the vertebrae
being found near the surface, but most of the bones were around the
skull. The body dressed and wrapped in matting had been placed
between four large boulders.</p>

<p>202-8223. Fragments of leather or skin clothing.</p>

<p>202-8224. Dentalium shells.</p>

<p>202-8228. A bit of a fresh water shell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Grave No. 32. Rock-slide grave located about 30 feet south southwest of grave
No. 31 and in the same rock-slide. It had the same characteristics
but had evidently been disturbed, the skull being missing. No
artifacts were found in the grave.</p>

<p>99-4327. Adult skeleton without skull and some bones of a little child. The bones
of an adult were found in a heap except the vertebrae which lay
extended full length; cervical vertebrae to the north. The bones of
one ankle, a tibia, and fibula were diseased. The cervical vertebrae
are anchylosed; and one of the ribs is abnormal. The bones of the
knees are partly bleached. The bones of the child being found
between the ribs and the pelvis suggest that it was foetal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Grave No. 33. Rock-slide grave located 40 feet south southwest from grave No. 31
in the same rock-slide with it. There was nothing on the surface to
indicate this grave, but below the surface of the slide on the upper
side of the grave, were three rows of sticks, about 3 feet long, standing
vertically and close to each other. These seemed to be so placed that
they would prevent the slide from further movement towards the
grave. The grave cavity was 5 feet south southeast by 4 feet east
northeast and 4 feet deep on one side, 3 feet on the other, or averaging
about 3-&frac12; feet deep, and extending into the soil below the slide.
Numbers 99-4328 and 202-8229 to 202-8230 were found in this grave.</p>

<p>99-4328. In the bottom of the grave the skeleton of a youth was found. It was in
good condition, lying on its back, facing west, but having rolled
westward. The legs were flexed so that the femora lay at right
angles or to the southeast of the pelvis, and the tibiae and fibulae lay
parallel to them. The arms lay extended at the sides of the body
with the hands on the pelvis. Three of the arm bones and one<span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>
pelvis bone are stained by copper. The tibia of a child was found
with these.</p>

<p>202-8229. Mat of twined rushes found under the pelvis. The rushes were stitched
together in pairs with cord and each pair was twisted once between
each stitch (<a href="#f71">Fig. 71</a>).</p>

<p>202-8230. Open twine matting of rushes held together with cords woven around
them, skin with hair on it, and in this were copper beads strung with
beads made of dentalium shells on a leather thong (<a href="#f72">Fig. 72</a>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Grave No. 34. Rock-slide grave found 5 feet south southwest of grave No. 32.
There were no surface indications of the grave. Posts of decayed
wood were found extending from the surface down to about 6 inches
from the bottom. The tops appeared to have been cut off and probably
never extended above the surface. Numbers 99-4329 and 202-8231
to 202-8246 were found in this grave.</p>

<p>99-4329. The skeleton of a young child with a persistent frontal suture was found
at a depth of from 3 to 4 feet with the head east, trunk on back,
femora at right angles to tibiae, and fibulae parallel to them, flexed
to left or south.</p>

<p>202-8231. Skin with the hair on found on body.</p>

<p>202-8232. Matting.</p>

<p>202-8233. Several rows of beads, some of copper, others of glass and still others of
sections of dentalium shells were found at the neck, arms and legs.
These are strung on pieces of thong, some of which are wound at the
ends. Some of them are on coarse twisted, and others on fine twisted
plant fibre (<a href="#f74">Fig. 74</a>).</p>

<p>Grave No. 35. Rock-slide grave located in the same slide with Nos. 31, 32, 33 and
34, 8 feet to the south southwest of No. 34. The grave was 3 feet in
diameter by 4 feet deep. Four posts of poplar were found at the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>
corners of this grave but these did not show above the surface being
decayed down to within 6 or 8 inches of the ground under the rock-slide.
Sticks had also been used to mark this grave on the surface.

<p>Grave No. 36. A rock-enclosure burial located on the hill south of Mr. Bull's house
near the gap south of Ellensburg and about 300 feet north of grave
No. 30. This burial was the southwestern of a group of eight, all very
close together and of which the southern circular enclosure of five
had been rifled although the three oblong enclosures were intact.
There were traces of human bones in all of the eight enclosures. The
enclosure to the north contained a skeleton that had been burned.
No. 36 differed from No. 30 in that the stones did not extend below
the surface.</p>

<p>99-4331. At a depth of 3 feet, in the grave pit 5 feet by 3 feet was the skeleton of
an adult lying with the head north, face east, on the left side, arms
extended to pelvis, legs flexed to left, i.e., to east. No specimens
